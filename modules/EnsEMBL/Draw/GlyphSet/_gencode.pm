package EnsEMBL::Draw::GlyphSet::_gencode;

### Module for drawing the gencode track inheriting from _transcript.pm, we dont have any web data in the database for gencode. Its a workaround to create a separate track for attribute type gencode.

use strict;

use List::Util qw(min max);

use base qw(EnsEMBL::Draw::GlyphSet::_transcript);

sub max_label_rows { return $_[0]->my_config('max_label_rows') || 2; }

sub only_attrib { return 'gencode_basic'; }
