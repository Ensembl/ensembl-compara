#   DESCRIPTION:    Bumping code.  Pass in the start and end of the thing you
#		    want bumping, the length of the thing to bump against, and
#		    a reference to an array.  The array will be modified by
#		    this subroutine, to maintain persistence.

# Fast bumping for new drawing code. This method just sets _bstart and
# _bend (the start and end co-ordinates for the purposes of bumping)
# according to the feature start and end and any label start and end.
# It then delegates to bumping to do_bump. If you want to set these
# keys yourself, to customise the bumping (ag GlpyhSet_simpler does)
# then feel free, and just call do_bump. For a description of the new
# bumping algorithm see do_bump.
# We deliberately compute label widths even if not displaying them.
# This helps when, eg, we will later bump labels elsewhere, eg in the
# gene renderer.

# Bump features according to their [_bstart,_bend], and set the row to a
# new key _bump in that method. On large regions (in bp terms) this can
# be orders of magnitude faster than the old algorithm.
#
# We can do this efficiently now, without tricks and big data structures
# because we have all features in-hand, and so can choose the order of
# applying them. Bumping amounts to an algorithm which attempts to add a
# range to a list of existing ranges (rows), adding it to the first with
# which there is no overlap. We sort the additions by start coordinate.
# For each row, we store the largest end co-ord on that row to-date.
# We add to the first row where our start is less than that row's end
# (and then set it to our end).
# If a row has an end greater than our start as we know it must have
# been set by a feature with a start less than ours (because of the
# order of addition), we know there is an overlap, and so this row is
# not available to us. Conversely, if our start is greater than the
# current end, we know that all features must be strictly to our left
# (also because of the order) and so we guarantee no overlap. Therefore
# this guarantees the minimum correct row.
