=head1 FailOver

=head2 Introduction

The FailOver module is designed to handle potentially unreliable resources,
probably from remote servers, by providing a common framework for
remembering that a resource was unavialable for a period of time, and so
minimising the impact of potentially expensive checks.

You write a subclass containing your checks and configuration and when
you've done that, this superclass will provide you with a pair of methods
to try the unreliable operation. One method, ->go, is for more complex
situations, and ->get_cached for simpler ones. You will only need to use
one of the two.

=head2 Simpler Method (get_cached)

For the simpler method, first override ->attempt. The call will be passed
two arguments. The first, endpoint, will be the string "only", unless
you have had reason to change it, and can safely be ignored (see "Multiple
Endpoints" if you are curious). The second, payload, is a copy of the
argument to the call to get_cached. This method should perform the risky
operation and return its result.

Then override ->successful. This will be passed the result of an attempt
and should return true or false values depending on whether the result
"looks like" a success or not.

Now create an object using a prefix unique to your implementation (this
is just a string which means files for failovers can all be stored in
the same directory).

You can now call ->get_cached. On the first attempt it will call your
attempt, and then test if it was a success or not by calling ->successful
with the result. If successful, the value will be returned, otherwise
undef will be returned. On later attempts, if early attempts failed then
undef will always be returned for some period of time.

Example:

  package EnsEMBL::Web::Tools::FailOver::My;
  use base qw(EnsEMBL::Web::Tools::FailOver);

  sub attempt {
    my ($endpoint,$payload) = @_;
    # Say this method returns a positive number if it's ok
    return do_the_thing_that_might_fail($payload); 
  }

  sub successful { return $_[1] > 0; }

Now you can do:

  my $fail = EnsEMBL::Web::Tools::FailOver::My->new("example");
  $payload = ... data for do_the_thing_that_might_fail() ...
  my $out = $fail->get_cached($payload);

$out will be the result of the operation if everything is up. If something
goes down, suuccessful returns a false value, and $out is set to undef.
For some time, $out then continues to return undef without even calling
attempt.
