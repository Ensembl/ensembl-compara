=head1 NAME

Bio::EnsEMBL::Compara::RunnableDB::ReindexMembers::DeleteOldMember

=head1 SYNOPSIS

This runnable will delete references to a member that doesn't exist any more.
It is expected to work in conjunction with an analysis that deletes the trees
and their alignments and homologies, as it will not clean up these tables.
