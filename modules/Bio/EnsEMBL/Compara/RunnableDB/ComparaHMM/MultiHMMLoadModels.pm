=head1 NAME

Bio::EnsEMBL::Compara::RunnableDB::ComparaHMM::MultiHMMLoadModels


=head1 SYNOPSIS

To load RFAM models from the FTP, use these parameters:
 url: ftp://ftp.sanger.ac.uk/pub/databases/Rfam/11.0/
 remote_file: Rfam.cm.gz
 expander: gunzip
 expanded_basename: Rfam.cm
To load the models from a file, do something like:
 cm_file_or_directory: /lustre/scratch110/ensembl/mp12/pfamA_HMM_fs.txt
or
 cm_file_or_directory: /lustre/scratch109/sanger/fs9/treefam8_hmms


=head1 DESCRIPTION

This Analysis/RunnableDB is designed to download a file that contains all
the HMM models, and load them into the database to be used in the
alignment process.
It can also directly process the file if "cm_file_or_directory" is defined.
