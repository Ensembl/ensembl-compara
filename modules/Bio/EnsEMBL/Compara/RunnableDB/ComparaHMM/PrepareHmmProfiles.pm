=head1 NAME

Bio::EnsEMBL::Compara::RunnableDB::ComparaHMM::PrepareHmmProfiles

=head1 SYNOPSIS

This runnable is used to:
    1 - fetch profiles from the database
    2 - create directory
    3 - concatenate all the profiles into one single file
    5 - run hmmpress

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This Analysis/RunnableDB is designed fetch all the recently generated HMM3 profiles from the databases and create the new Compara HMM profiles.
