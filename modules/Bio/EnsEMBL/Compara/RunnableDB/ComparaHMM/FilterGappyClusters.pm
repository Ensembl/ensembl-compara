=head1 NAME

Bio::EnsEMBL::Compara::RunnableDB::ComparaHMM::FilterGappyClusters

=head1 SYNOPSIS

This runnable is used to:
    1 - get percentage of gaps
    2 - use max_gappiness parameter to remove unwanted profiles 

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This Analysis/RunnableDB is designed to filter out clusters that are too gappy.
It uses the max_gappiness parameter as a cutoff.
