=head1 NAME

Bio::EnsEMBL::Compara::RunnableDB::ObjectFactory

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This is a Compara-specific generic job factory that:
    1) Starting with the $self object executes a list of calls
      (usually, getting the database, then an adaptor, calling a fetch, etc) which returns a list in the end.
    2) Iterates through the list and flows each object into a job using a given getter-to-column mapping.

It also serves as a good simple example of a Compara job factory:
    1) Inherits main factory functionality from Hive::RunnableDB::JobFactory
    2) Inherits Compara-specific functionality (like $self->compara_dba ) from Compara::RunnableDB::BaseRunnable
    3) Only defines fetch_input() method that takes specific parameters, uses API to fetch data and sets the $self->param('inputlist') in the end.
