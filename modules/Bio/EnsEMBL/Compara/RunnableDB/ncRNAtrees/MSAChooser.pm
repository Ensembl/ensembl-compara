=head1 NAME

Bio::EnsEMBL::Compara::RunnableDB::ProteinTrees::MCoffee

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This Analysis/RunnableDB is designed to take a nc_tree cluster as input
Run an MCOFFEE multiple alignment on it, and store the resulting alignment
back into the nc_tree_member table.

input_id/parameters format eg: "{'gene_tree_id'=>726093}"
    gene_tree_id       : use family_id to run multiple alignment on its members
    options            : commandline options to pass to the 'mcoffee' program

=head1 SYNOPSIS

my $db     = Bio::EnsEMBL::Compara::DBAdaptor->new($locator);
my $mcoffee = Bio::EnsEMBL::Compara::RunnableDB::Mcoffee->new (
                                                    -db      => $db,
                                                    -input_id   => $input_id,
                                                    -analysis   => $analysis );
$mcoffee->fetch_input(); #reads from DB
$mcoffee->run();
$mcoffee->write_output(); #writes to DB
