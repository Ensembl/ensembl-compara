=head1 NAME

Bio::EnsEMBL::Compara::RunnableDB::GeneSetQC::FindOrphans

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Here we expect that a gene should be in a tree and a family, mixed with
other genes from other species. This Runnable reports the genes that don't
follow this rule.

=head1 SYNOPSIS

standaloneJob.pl Bio::EnsEMBL::Compara::RunnableDB::GeneSetQC::FindOrphans \
 -compara_db mysql://server/mm14_protein_trees_82 -genome_db_id 150

=head1 AUTHORSHIP
