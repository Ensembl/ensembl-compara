=head1 NAME

Bio::EnsEMBL::Compara::RunnableDB::ProteinTrees::MoveComponentGenes

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Moves genes between the dnafrags of two species. This is in practice
used for polyploid genomes and their components.

=head1 AUTHORSHIP

Ensembl Team. Individual contributions can be found in the GIT log.

=head1 APPENDIX

The rest of the documentation details each of the object methods.
