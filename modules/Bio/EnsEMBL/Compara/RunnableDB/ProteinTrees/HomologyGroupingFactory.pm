Bio::EnsEMBL::Compara::RunnableDB::ProteinTrees::HomologyGroupingFactory

=cut

=head1 SYNOPSIS

my $aa = $sdba->get_AnalysisAdaptor;
my $analysis = $aa->fetch_by_logic_name('HomologyGroupingFactory');
my $rdb = new Bio::EnsEMBL::Compara::RunnableDB::ProteinTrees::HomologyGroupingFactory(
                         -input_id   => [[1,2,3,14],[4,13],[11,16]]
                         -analysis   => $analysis);

$rdb->fetch_input
$rdb->run;

=cut

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This is a homology compara specific runnableDB, that based on an input
of arrayrefs of genome_db_ids, creates Homology_dNdS jobs in the hive 
analysis_job table.
