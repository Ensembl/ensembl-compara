=head1 NAME

Bio::EnsEMBL::Compara::RunnableDB::ProteinTrees::Noisy;

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This Analysis/RunnableDB is designed to take a root_id as input.
This must already have a multiple alignment run on it. 
It uses that alignment as input to the filterring tool Noisy.

input_id/parameters format eg: "{'gene_tree_id'=>1234}"
    gene_tree_id : use 'id' to fetch a cluster from the ProteinTree
