=head1 NAME

Bio::EnsEMBL::Compara::RunnableDB::GeneTrees::RemoveOverlappingHomologies

=head1 DESCRIPTION

When we build the mouse-strains protein-trees we end up with two database
both having some homology MLSS (e.g. rat vs mouse).
We decide here to remove the redundant MLSSs and their homologies from the
dependent database.
