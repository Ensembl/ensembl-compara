=head1 NAME

Bio::EnsEMBL::Compara::RunnableDB::GeneTrees::OrthologyStats

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This runnable will store statistics on a given homology MLSS ID.
For orthologs, it extracts:
 n_${homology_type}_(pairs|groups)
 n_${homology_type}_${genome_db_id}_genes
 avg_${homology_type}_${genome_db_id}_perc_id
