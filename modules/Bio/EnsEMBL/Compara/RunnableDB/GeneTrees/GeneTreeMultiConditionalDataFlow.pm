=head1 DESCRIPTION

This is another implementation of condition-based dataflows (see RunnableDB::ConditionalDataFlow). Whilst the later is
a if-then-else structure, this is more like if-if*-else.
The hash "branches" lists all the branches that can be dataflown to, and the conditions that should first be met to do so.

The recognized parameters are:
    - branches: A hash of the form "branch number" -> "condition"
    - else_branch: the branch number to dataflow to in case none of the conditions have been met

In the above example, the RunnableDB will dataflow on branch #2 if there are more than 400 genes in the tree with root_id=3,
to branch #4 if there are less than 200 genes, and to branch #3 otherwise, which is between 200 and 400 genes.
