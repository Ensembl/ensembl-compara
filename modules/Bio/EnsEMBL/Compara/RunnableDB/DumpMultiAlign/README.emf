IMPORTANT: Please note you can download correlation data tables,
supported by Ensembl, via the highly customisable BioMart and
EnsMart data mining tools. See http://www.ensembl.org/multi/martview or

Ensembl Multi Format (EMF) FLATFILE DUMPS
-----------------------------------------
This directory contains Compara EMF flatfile dumps.  To ease
downloading of the files, an EMF file is created for each chromosome.
All files are then compacted with GNU Zip for storage efficiency.

EMF files store:

1.  Whole-genome multiple alignments created by the Ensembl
Comparative Genomics team (compara).

2.  Genesbased multiple alignments created by the Ensembl Comparative
Genomics team (gene_alignment).

3.  Alignments of resequencing data from individuals
(or strains) to the reference genome assembly created by the Ensembl
Functional Genomics team (resequencing).

The file format is very similar for all uses, with differences noted below.
This README represents verion 1.0 of the EMF specification.

----------
FILE NAMES
----------
The files are consistently named following this pattern:
<species>.<assembly>.<release>.<data type>.<region>.emf.gz

EXAMPLE EMF resequencing data file names
Mus_musculus.NCBIM36.43.resequencing.chromosome.Y.emf.gz
Homo_sapiens.NCBI36.43.resequencing.chromosome.X.emf.gz
Rattus_norvegicus.RGSC3.4.43.resequencing.chromosome.7.emf.gz

EXAMPLE EMF whole-genome multiple alignment (compara) data file names
Compara.pecan_7_way.chr13_1.emf.gz
Compara.pecan_gerp_10_way.chr3_5.emf.gz
Compara.pecan_gerp_10_way.others_1.emf.gz

EXAMPLE EMF genebased multiple alignment (gene_alignment) data file names
