=head1 NAME

Bio::EnsEMBL::Compara::RunnableDB::OrthologQM::AssignQualityScore

=head1 SYNOPSIS

	Writes final score for the homology into homology.wga_coverage

=head1 DESCRIPTION

	Inputs:
	{homology_id => score}

	Outputs:
	No data is dataflowed from this runnable
	Score is written to homology table of compara_db option
