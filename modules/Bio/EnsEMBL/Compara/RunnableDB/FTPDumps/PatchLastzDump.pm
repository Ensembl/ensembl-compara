=head1 NAME

Bio::EnsEMBL::Compara::RunnableDB::FTPDumps::PatchLastzDump

=head1 SYNOPSIS

	1. locate the newly copied patch dumps and the tarball from the old dumps
	2. untar/gz the old dump to tmp dir (because the new and old dir names will be the same - avoid clashes or uncertainty)
	3. copy everything to patch dump dir, md5sum, re-tar/gz
