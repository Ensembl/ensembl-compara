=head1 NAME

Bio::EnsEMBL::Compara::RunnableDB::UpdateMSA::UpdateGABFactory

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Flows 1 job per genomic align block id (and corresponding genomic align ids)
that are affected by the species removed in the given MSA MLSS.

=over

=item mlss_id

Mandatory. Current release MSA's MLSS id.

=item prev_mlss_id

Mandatory. Previous release MSA's MLSS id.
