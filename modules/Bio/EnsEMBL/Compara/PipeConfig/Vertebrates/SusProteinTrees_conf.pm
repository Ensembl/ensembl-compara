=head1 NAME

  Bio::EnsEMBL::Compara::PipeConfig::Vertebrates::SusProteinTrees_conf

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    #1. update ensembl-hive, ensembl and ensembl-compara GIT repositories before each new release

    #3. make sure that all default_options are set correctly

    #4. Run init_pipeline.pl script:
        init_pipeline.pl Bio::EnsEMBL::Compara::PipeConfig::Vertebrates::SusProteinTrees_conf -host mysql-ens-compara-prod-X -port XXXX \
            -mlss_id <curr_sus_ptree_mlss_id>

    #5. Sync and loop the beekeeper.pl as shown in init_pipeline.pl's output

=head1 DESCRIPTION

The Sus PipeConfig file for StrainsProteinTrees pipeline that should automate most of the pre-execution tasks.

=head1 AUTHORSHIP

Ensembl Team. Individual contributions can be found in the GIT log.

=head1 APPENDIX

The rest of the documentation details each of the object methods.
