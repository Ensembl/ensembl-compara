=head1 NAME

Bio::EnsEMBL::Compara::PipeConfig::Parts::HighConfidenceOrthologs

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This pipeline-part analyzes the orthologies and flags the best ones as
"high-confidence", following a number of thresholds.

=head1 USAGE

=head2 eHive configuration

This pipeline fires 1 job per orthology MLSS, which are relatively fast
too, so you will have to set 'high_confidence_capacity'.

Jobs require less than 100MB of memory.

=head2 Seeding

Job really only require a database location.

=head2 Global parameters

These parameters are required by several analyses and should probably
be declared as pipeline-wide. They can otherwise be set at the first job.

=item threshold_levels

"threshold_levels" is an array of selectors that are evaluated in order.
Each element is a hash that defines some taxon names and the filter to
apply on their homologies.

When a taxon is considered, all the MLSSs that join two species below it
will be selected. The filter consists of three thresholds: the minimum values
for respectively the GOC score, the WGA coverage and the minimum percentage
of identity of the pair of orthologues.

Example:

        'threshold_levels' => [
            {
                'taxa'          => [ 'Apes', 'Murinae' ],
                'thresholds'    => [ 75, 75, 80 ],
            },
            {
                'taxa'          => [ 'Mammalia', 'Aves', 'Percomorpha' ],
                'thresholds'    => [ 75, 75, 50 ],
            },
            {
                'taxa'          => [ 'Euteleostomi' ],
                'thresholds'    => [ 50, 50, 25 ],
            },
            {
                'taxa'          => [ 'all' ],
                'thresholds'    => [ undef, undef, 25 ],
            },
        ],

=item range_filter, range_label

If the pipeline needs to process only a subset of the homologies,
these can be defined with an additional filter: a list of ranges.
The statistics will then be stored in the database with the label
added to their names.
