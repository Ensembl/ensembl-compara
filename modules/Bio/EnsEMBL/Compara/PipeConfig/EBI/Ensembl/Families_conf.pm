=head1 NAME

Bio::EnsEMBL::Compara::PipeConfig::Example::EnsemblFamilies_conf

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    #1. update ensembl-hive, ensembl and ensembl-compara GIT repositories before each new release

    #2. Ensure that LoadMembers pipeline have been run

    #3. make sure that all default_options are set correctly

    #4. Run init_pipeline.pl script:

        init_pipeline.pl Bio::EnsEMBL::Compara::PipeConfig::EBI::Ensembl::Families_conf \
        -password <your_password> -mlss_id <your_current_Family_mlss_id>

    #5. Sync and loop the beekeeper.pl as shown in init_pipeline.pl's output

=head1 DESCRIPTION

The PipeConfig file for ProteinTrees pipeline that should automate most of the pre-execution tasks.

=head1 AUTHORSHIP

Ensembl Team. Individual contributions can be found in the GIT log.
