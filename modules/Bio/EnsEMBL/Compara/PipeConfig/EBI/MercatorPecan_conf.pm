=head1 NAME

Bio::EnsEMBL::Compara::PipeConfig::EBI::MercatorPecan_conf

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    #1. update ensembl-hive, ensembl and ensembl-compara GIT repositories before each new release

    #3. make sure that all default_options are set correctly

    #4. Run init_pipeline.pl script:
        init_pipeline.pl Bio::EnsEMBL::Compara::PipeConfig::EBI::MercatorPecan_conf -password <your_password> -mlss_id <your_current_Pecan_mlss_id>

    #5. Sync and loop the beekeeper.pl as shown in init_pipeline.pl's output


=head1 DESCRIPTION  

    The PipeConfig file for MercatorPecan pipeline that should automate most of the pre-execution tasks.

    FYI: it took (3.7 x 24h) to perform the full production run for EnsEMBL release 62.
