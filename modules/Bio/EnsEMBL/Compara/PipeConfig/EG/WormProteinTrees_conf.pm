=head1 NAME

  Bio::EnsEMBL::Compara::PipeConfig::EBI::EG::WormProteinTrees_conf

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    #1. update ensembl-hive, ensembl and ensembl-compara GIT repositories before each new release

    #2. you may need to update 'schema_version' in meta table to the current release number in ensembl-hive/sql/tables.sql

    #3. make sure that all default_options are set correctly

    #4. Run init_pipeline.pl script:
        init_pipeline.pl Bio::EnsEMBL::Compara::PipeConfig::EBI::EG::WormProteinTrees_conf \
        -password <your_password> -mlss_id <your_current_PT_mlss_id> \
        -division <eg_division> -eg_release <egrelease>

    #5. Sync and loop the beekeeper.pl as shown in init_pipeline.pl's output


=head1 DESCRIPTION

    The PipeConfig example file for the WormBase  group's version of
    ProteinTrees pipeline. This file is inherited from & customised further
    within the Ensembl Genomes infrastructure but this file serves as
    an example of the type of configuration we perform.
