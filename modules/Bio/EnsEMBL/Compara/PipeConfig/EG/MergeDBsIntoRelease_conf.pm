=head1 NAME

Bio::EnsEMBL::Compara::PipeConfig::EG::MergeDBsIntoRelease_conf

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    #1. update all databases' names and locations

    #2. initialize the pipeline:
        init_pipeline.pl Bio::EnsEMBL::Compara::PipeConfig::EG::MergeDBsIntoRelease_conf -host mysql-ens-compara-prod-X -port XXXX

    #3. run the beekeeper.pl

=head1 DESCRIPTION

A Ensembl Genomes specific pipeline to merge some production databases onto the release one.
It is currently working well only with the "gene side" of Compara
(protein_trees, families and ncrna_trees)
because synteny_region_id is not ranged by MLSS.
