=head1 DESCRIPTION

This modules contains a few additional methods to test the type of
of scalars

=head2 assert_ref_or_dbID

  Arg [1]     : The reference to check
  Arg [2]     : The type we expect
  Arg [3]     : The attribute name you are asserting; not required but allows
                for more useful error messages to be generated. Defaults to
                C<-Unknown->.
  Description : A subroutine which checks to see if the given object/ref is
                what you expect or a potential dbID. This behaves in an
                identical manner as C<check_ref()> does except this will raise
                exceptions when the values do not match rather than returning
                a boolean indicating the situation.

                Undefs cause exception circumstances.
                
                You can turn assertions off by using the global variable
                $Bio::EnsEMBL::Utils::Scalar::ASSERTIONS = 0
  Returntype  : Boolean; true if we managed to get to the return
  Example     : assert_ref_or_dbID(90, 'Bio::EnsEMBL::Compara::GenomeDB');
  Exceptions  : If the expected type was not set and if the given reference
                was not assignable to the expected value
  Status      : Stable
