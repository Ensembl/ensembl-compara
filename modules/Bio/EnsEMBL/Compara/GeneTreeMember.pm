=head1 NAME

Bio::EnsEMBL::Compara::GeneTreeMember

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Currently the GeneTreeMember objects are used to represent the leaves of
the gene trees (whether they contain proteins or non-coding RNAs).

Each GeneTreeMember object is simultaneously a tree node (inherits from
GeneTreeNode) and an aligned member (inherits from AlignedMember).

The object only overrides a few methods from its parents, and does not have additional functionality.

=head1 INHERITANCE TREE

  Bio::EnsEMBL::Compara::GeneTreeMember
  +- Bio::EnsEMBL::Compara::AlignedMember
  `- Bio::EnsEMBL::Compara::GeneTreeNode

=head1 AUTHORSHIP

Ensembl Team. Individual contributions can be found in the GIT log.

=head1 APPENDIX

The rest of the documentation details each of the object methods.
Internal methods are usually preceded with an underscore (_)

=head1 METHODS

=cut

package Bio::EnsEMBL::Compara::GeneTreeMember;

use strict;
use warnings;

use base ('Bio::EnsEMBL::Compara::AlignedMember', 'Bio::EnsEMBL::Compara::GeneTreeNode');  # careful with the order; new() is currently inherited from Member-AlignedMember branch


=head2 copy

  Arg [1]     : none
  Example     : $copy = $gene_tree_member->copy();
  Description : Creates a new GeneTreeMember object from an existing one
  Returntype  : Bio::EnsEMBL::Compara::GeneTreeMember
  Exceptions  : none
  Caller      : general
  Status      : Stable

=cut

  return $mycopy;
}


=head2 string_node (overrides default method in Bio::EnsEMBL::Compara::NestedSet)

  Arg [1]     : none
  Example     : $aligned_member->string_node();
  Description : Outputs the info for this GeneTreeMember. First, the node_id, the
                left and right indexes are printed, then the species name. If the
                gene member can be determined, the methods prints the stable_id,
                the display label and location of the gene member, otherwise the
                seq_member_id and stable_id of the object are printed.
  Returntype  : none
  Exceptions  : none
  Caller      : general
  Status      : Stable

=head2 name (overrides default method in Bio::EnsEMBL::Compara::Graph::Node)

  Arg [1]     : none
  Example     : $aligned_member->name();
  Description : Returns the stable_id of the object (from the Bio::EnsEMBL::Compara::Member object).
  Returntype  : string
  Exceptions  : none
  Caller      : general
  Status      : Stable
