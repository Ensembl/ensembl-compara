    Title   :   filter
    Usage   :   filter(\@)
    Function:   Clean the Array of Bio::EnsEMBL::DnaDnaAlignFeature in 2 steps, 
                First, sort FeaturePairs by score descending, identity % descending
                Second, hits are kept if they do not exactly overlap the subject sequence of previous strored, 
                higher scored hits.
    Returns :   Array reference of Bio::EnsEMBL::DnaDnaAlignFeature
    Args    :   Array reference of Bio::EnsEMBL::DnaDnaAlignFeature
