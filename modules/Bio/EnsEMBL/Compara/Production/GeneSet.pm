=head1 NAME

Bio::EnsEMBL::Compara::Production::GeneSet

=cut

=head1 SYNOPSIS

An abstract data class for holding an arbitrary collection of
(ENSEMBLGENE)Member objects and providing set operations and 
cross-reference operations to compare to another GeneSet object.
Also used by HomologySet.

=cut

=head1 DESCRIPTION

A 'set' object of Gene objects.  Uses Member::stable_id to identify unique genes.  
Is used for comparing GeneSet objects with each other and building comparison
matrixes.

Not really a production object, but more an abstract data type for use by
post analysis scripts.  Placed in Production since I could not think of a better location.
The design of this object essentially was within the homology_diff.pl script
but has now been formalized into a proper object design.
