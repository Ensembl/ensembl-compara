=head1 INTRODUCTION

(by Mark-Jason Dominus)

I once read an article written by the authors of C<diff>; they said
that they hard worked very hard on the algorithm until they found the
right one.

I think what they ended up using (and I hope someone will correct me,
because I am not very confident about this) was the `longest common
subsequence' method.  in the LCS problem, you have two sequences of
items:

        a b c d f g h j q z

        a b c d e f g i j k r x y z

and you want to find the longest sequence of items that is present in
both original sequences in the same order.  That is, you want to find
a new sequence I<S> which can be obtained from the first sequence by
deleting some items, and from the secend sequence by deleting other
items.  You also want I<S> to be as long as possible.  In this case
I<S> is

        a b c d f g j z

From there it's only a small step to get diff-like output:

        e   h i   k   q r x y 
        +   - +   +   - + + +

This module solves the LCS problem.  It also includes a canned
function to generate C<diff>-like output.

It might seem from the example above that the LCS of two sequences is
always pretty obvious, but that's not always the case, especially when
the two sequences have many repeated elements.  For example, consider

	a x b y c z p d q
	a b c a x b y c z

A naive approach might start by matching up the C<a> and C<b> that
appear at the beginning of each sequence, like this:

	a x b y c         z p d q
	a   b   c a b y c z

This finds the common subsequence C<a b c z>.  But actually, the LCS
is C<a x b y c z>:

	      a x b y c z p d q
	a b c a x b y c z

=head1 USAGE

This module provides three exportable functions, which we'll deal with in
ascending order of difficulty: C<LCS>, C<diff>, and
C<traverse_sequences>.

=head2 C<LCS>

Given references to two lists of items, LCS returns an array containing their
longest common subsequence.  In scalar context, it returns a reference to
such a list.

  @lcs    = LCS( \@seq1, \@seq2 );
  $lcsref = LCS( \@seq1, \@seq2 );

C<LCS> may be passed an optional third parameter; this is a CODE
reference to a key generation function.  See L</KEY GENERATION
FUNCTIONS>.

  @lcs    = LCS( \@seq1, \@seq2, $keyGen );
  $lcsref = LCS( \@seq1, \@seq2, $keyGen );

Additional parameters, if any, will be passed to the key generation
routine.

=head2 C<diff>

  @diffs     = diff( \@seq1, \@seq2 );
  $diffs_ref = diff( \@seq1, \@seq2 );

C<diff> computes the smallest set of additions and deletions necessary
to turn the first sequence into the second, and returns a description
of these changes.  The description is a list of I<hunks>; each hunk
represents a contiguous section of items which should be added,
deleted, or replaced.  The return value of C<diff> is a list of
hunks, or, in scalar context, a reference to such a list.

Here is an example:  The diff of the following two sequences:

  a b c e h j l m n p
  b c d e f j k l m r s t

Result:

 [ 
   [ [ '-', 0, 'a' ] ],       

   [ [ '+', 2, 'd' ] ],

   [ [ '-', 4, 'h' ] , 
     [ '+', 4, 'f' ] ],

   [ [ '+', 6, 'k' ] ],

   [ [ '-', 8, 'n' ], 
     [ '-', 9, 'p' ], 
     [ '+', 9, 'r' ], 
     [ '+', 10, 's' ], 
     [ '+', 11, 't' ],
   ]
 ]

There are five hunks here.  The first hunk says that the C<a> at
position 0 of the first sequence should be deleted (C<->).  The second
hunk says that the C<d> at position 2 of the second sequence should
be inserted (C<+>).  The third hunk says that the C<h> at position 4
of the first sequence should be removed and replaced with the C<f>
from position 4 of the second sequence.  The other two hunks similarly. 

C<diff> may be passed an optional third parameter; this is a CODE
reference to a key generation function.  See L</KEY GENERATION
FUNCTIONS>.

Additional parameters, if any, will be passed to the key generation
routine.

=head2 C<traverse_sequences>

C<traverse_sequences> is the most general facility provided by this
module; C<diff> and C<LCS> are implemented as calls to it.

Imagine that there are two arrows.  Arrow A points to an element of
sequence A, and arrow B points to an element of the sequence B.
Initially, the arrows point to the first elements of the respective
sequences.  C<traverse_sequences> will advance the arrows through the
sequences one element at a time, calling an appropriate user-specified
callback function before each advance.  It willadvance the arrows in
such a way that if there are equal elements C<$A[$i]> and C<$B[$j]>
which are equal and which are part of the LCS, there will be some
moment during the execution of C<traverse_sequences> when arrow A is
pointing to C<$A[$i]> and arrow B is pointing to C<$B[$j]>.  When this
happens, C<traverse_sequences> will call the C<MATCH> callback
function and then it will advance both arrows. 

Otherwise, one of the arrows is pointing to an element of its sequence
that is not part of the LCS.  C<traverse_sequences> will advance that
arrow and will call the C<DISCARD_A> or the C<DISCARD_B> callback,
depending on which arrow it advanced.  If both arrows point to
elements that are not part of the LCS, then C<traverse_sequences> will
advance one of them and call the appropriate callback, but it is not
specified which it will call.

The arguments to C<traverse_sequences> are the two sequences to
traverse, and a callback which specifies the callback functions, like
this:

  traverse_sequences( \@seq1, \@seq2,
                     { MATCH => $callback_1,
                       DISCARD_A => $callback_2,
                       DISCARD_B => $callback_3,
                     } );

Callbacks are invoked with at least the indices of the two arrows as
their arguments.  They are not expected to return any values.  If a
callback is omitted from the table, it is not called.

If arrow A reaches the end of its sequence, before arrow B does,
C<traverse_sequences> will call the C<A_FINISHED> callback when it
advances arrow B, if there is such a function; if not it will call
C<DISCARD_B> instead.  Similarly if arrow B finishes first.
C<traverse_sequences> returns when both arrows are at the ends of
their respective sequences.  It returns true on success and false on
failure.  At present there is no way to fail.

C<traverse_sequences> may be passed an optional fourth parameter; this
is a CODE reference to a key generation function.  See L</KEY
GENERATION FUNCTIONS>.

Additional parameters, if any, will be passed to the key generation
function.

=head1 KEY GENERATION FUNCTIONS

C<diff>, C<LCS>, and C<traverse_sequences> accept an optional last parameter.
This is a CODE reference to a key generating (hashing) function that should
return a string that uniquely identifies a given element.
It should be the case that if two elements are to be considered equal,
their keys should be the same (and the other way around).
If no key generation function is provided, the key will be the
element as a string.

By default, comparisons will use "eq" and elements will be turned into keys
using the default stringizing operator '""'.

Where this is important is when you're comparing something other than
strings. If it is the case that you have multiple different objects 
that should be considered to be equal, you should supply a key
generation function. Otherwise, you have to make sure that your arrays
contain unique references.

For instance, consider this example:

  package Person;

  sub new
  {
    my $package = shift;
    return bless { name => '', ssn => '', @_ }, $package;
  }

  sub clone
  {
    my $old = shift;
    my $new = bless { %$old }, ref($old);
  }

  sub hash
  {
    return shift()->{'ssn'};
  }

  my $person1 = Person->new( name => 'Joe', ssn => '123-45-6789' );
  my $person2 = Person->new( name => 'Mary', ssn => '123-47-0000' );
  my $person3 = Person->new( name => 'Pete', ssn => '999-45-2222' );
  my $person4 = Person->new( name => 'Peggy', ssn => '123-45-9999' );
  my $person5 = Person->new( name => 'Frank', ssn => '000-45-9999' );

If you did this:

  my $array1 = [ $person1, $person2, $person4 ];
  my $array2 = [ $person1, $person3, $person4, $person5 ];
  Algorithm::Diff::diff( $array1, $array2 );

everything would work out OK (each of the objects would be converted
into a string like "Person=HASH(0x82425b0)" for comparison).

But if you did this:

  my $array1 = [ $person1, $person2, $person4 ];
  my $array2 = [ $person1, $person3, $person4->clone(), $person5 ];
  Algorithm::Diff::diff( $array1, $array2 );

$person4 and $person4->clone() (which have the same name and SSN)
would be seen as different objects. If you wanted them to be considered
equivalent, you would have to pass in a key generation function:

  my $array1 = [ $person1, $person2, $person4 ];
  my $array2 = [ $person1, $person3, $person4->clone(), $person5 ];
  Algorithm::Diff::diff( $array1, $array2, \&Person::hash );

This would use the 'ssn' field in each Person as a comparison key, and
so would consider $person4 and $person4->clone() as equal.

You may also pass additional parameters to the key generation function
if you wish.
