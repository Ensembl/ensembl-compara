  Description : New method used for a new instance of the given object. 
                Required fields are indicated accordingly. Fields are specified
                using the Arguments syntax (case insensitive).

=head2 projections()

  Description : Getter.

=head2 write()

The subroutine we call in order to write projection data out

sub write {
  my ($self) = @_;
  foreach my $p (@{$self->projections()}) {
    $self->write_projection($p);
  }
}

=head2 write_projection()

The subroutine we call in order to write a single projection out 

=cut
