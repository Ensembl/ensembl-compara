=head2 total()

The current total of genes the target was mapped to (applies to 1:m) 
relationships

=cut

sub total {
  my ($self) = @_;
  return $self->{total};
}

=head2 current_index()

Current position of our iteration through the total amount of genes this
target is related to

=cut

sub current_index {
  my ($self) = @_;
  return $self->{current_index};
}

=head2 ignore()

Attribute which can only be set after construction since it is used
to optionally allow us to ignore an existing projection during a post
filtering stage.

=cut

sub ignore {
  my ($self, $ignore) = @_;
  $self->{ignore} = $ignore if defined $ignore;
  return $self->{ignore};
