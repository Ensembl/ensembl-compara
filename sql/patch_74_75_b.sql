# Title: New columns in genome_db: has_karyotype and is_high_coverage
#
# Description:
#   Introduce two new columns in genome_db: has_karyotype and is_high_coverage
#   "has_karyotype" is a boolean that is true if there is at least 1 slice
#    in the karyotype
#   "is_high_coverage" is a boolean that is true if the assembly has a high,
#    which is a proxy for the quality of the gene annotation
#   Both are normally automatically populated from the core database

ALTER TABLE genome_db
	ADD COLUMN has_karyotype TINYINT(1) NOT NULL DEFAULT 0 AFTER genebuild,
	ADD COLUMN is_high_coverage TINYINT(1) NOT NULL DEFAULT 0 AFTER has_karyotype;

# Patch identifier
INSERT INTO meta (species_id, meta_key, meta_value)
  VALUES (NULL, 'patch', 'patch_74_75_b.sql|genome_db_haskaryo_highcov');
