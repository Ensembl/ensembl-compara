# ensembl-webcode
The code to run an Ensembl website

The ensembl-webcode repository contains the essential code needed for an "Ensembl-powered" web interface
running on Apache and mod_perl with a MySQL backend. 
Note that for a fully functional site, you will also need the Ensembl Perl API and the public-plugins
supplementary web code. Thus the full set of code needed for a website consists of the following git repositories:

* ensembl
* ensembl-compara
* ensembl-funcgen
* ensembl-io
* ensembl-orm
* ensembl-variation
* ensembl-webcode
* public-plugins

In addiition, the following repositories are required for our Tools interface:

* ensembl-hive
* ensembl-tools

Further documentation on how to install and configure an Ensembl-powered website
can be found at http://www.ensembl.org/info/docs/webcode/index.html
