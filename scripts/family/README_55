#
# NB: if you are going to run Family pipeline in a separate database,
# make sure you have copied over all the necessary tables from tree/homology database (member, sequence, genome_db).
# Later make sure you have everything for a successful merger (non-colliding ids).


2- Choose a working directory with enough disk space
   ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

# Because we no longer keep Blast output in separate files,
# there are no file arrays, so all of the files can happily coexist in the same directory.
# It would be ideal that all blades of the farm and turing could have easy access to it.
#
# I am using ~/family_56 for this purpose.

mkdir ~/family_56

# In addition, we will need another directory for the BlastDB files to live in.
# /data/blastdb on Farm-1 has been compromised during 2 releases (55 and 56),
# so we are moving to Farm-2 and the proposed place for the BlastDB files is:

mkdir -p /lustre/scratch103/ensembl/lg4/family_56
cd /lustre/scratch103/ensembl/lg4/family_56


3- Loading in and dumping the peptides from compara
   ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

# The loading of ensembl peptides/genes and uniprot is now done as a common trunk with the gene homology pipeline.
# The loading process will identify redundant proteins using a MySQL index trick and assign to them the same 
# sequence_id. Very clever indeed!

# Before loading, make sure that in each core db:
# a) stable ids are in (look in tables 'exon_stable_id', 'translation_stable_id', 'transcript_stable_id' 
#    and 'gene_stable_id')

mysql -hens-staging -uensro -N -e  "show databases" | grep core | grep "\_56" | grep -v expression | while read i; do echo $i; echo "-----"; mysql -hens-staging -uensro $i -N -e "select * from exon_stable_id limit 10"; echo "---"; mysql -hens-staging -uensro $i -N -e "select * from translation_stable_id limit 10"; echo "---"; mysql -hens-staging -uensro $i -N -e "select * from transcript_stable_id limit 10"; echo "---"; mysql -hens-staging -uensro $i -N -e "select * from gene_stable_id limit 10"; echo "---"; done | less

# b) species data in 'meta' table up to date

mysql -hens-staging -uensro -N -e  "show databases" | grep core | grep "\_56" | grep -v expression | while read i; do echo $i; echo "-----"; mysql -hens-staging -uensro $i -N -e "select * from meta" | grep species; echo "---"; done | less

# c) check the gene type e.g. pseudogene or RNA that you don't want to load and update the filter out condition if necessary

mysql -hens-staging -uensro -N -e  "show databases" | grep core | grep "\_56" | grep -v expression | while read i; do echo $i; echo "-----"; mysql -hens-staging -uensro $i -N -e "select count(*) as number, biotype from gene group by biotype order by number desc"; echo "---"; done | less

4- Format the fasta file for Blast
   ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

# Formatting the fasta file for future BLASTPing:
#
#       WARNING! WARNING! WARNING!
#
#       Don't run it remotely on the farm. Neither run it in a "lustre" directory - they are clearly buggy (as of June 2009).
#       Take a risk and do the whole thing on the farm-login node in your home directory, and then copy the files over.
#       This is a very prescious database, as the whole pipeline will depend on it. Don't leave it to the LSF/lustre to break it.
#

6- Run FamilyBlast.pm analysis
   ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

# make sure the database contains mcl_matrix table:
#
mysql --host compara2 --port 3306 --user ensadmin --password=ensembl lg4_compara_families_56 -e 'DROP TABLE IF EXISTS mcl_matrix'
mysql --host compara2 --port 3306 --user ensadmin --password=ensembl  lg4_compara_families_56 -e 'CREATE TABLE mcl_matrix (id int(10) unsigned NOT NULL, rest mediumtext NOT NULL, PRIMARY KEY (id)) ENGINE=InnoDB'


# Load the analysis using the cmd_hive.pl script with somewhat extended functionality:

cd ~/family_56

# export PATH=$PATH:/nfs/team71/analysis/lg4/work/ensembl-hive/scripts

# in the long Q:

8- Build the matrix needed by mcl and check it for symmetry
   ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

# The following script is supposed to automate everything in "8- " and needs the following parameters:
#
#           (1) the DB connection parameters (this DB has to have a filled-in 'mcl_matrix' table)
#           (2) nameprefix (legacy from the way the mcxassemble.sh.tcx takes in the parameters)
#

## NB: it is better to execute this script on one of the Farm-2 machines - they now have an access to the 'hugemem' queue.
#  (otherwise the last step (the matrix assembly itself) will fail and may need to be re-submitted manually)

/nfs/team71/analysis/lg4/work/ensembl-compara_HEAD/scripts/family/dump_matrix_for_mcl.pl -dbhost compara2 -dbport 3306 -dbuser ensro -dbname lg4_compara_families_56 -nameprefix family_56

# After execution make sure you have kept .tcx file in a turing-accessible place and got rid of the huge .raw file.



9- Run mcl
   ~~~~~~~

This step uses turing which has 192Gb of memory :))) and 16 CPUs. As mcl can be multi-threaded, it is very useful.

Try to use 12 cpus, less if available in the hugemem queue, try to use lots of RAM, less if available:

for n in `seq 12 -1 1`
do
        for mem in `seq 95000 -20000 35000`
        do
                sleep 1
                hmem=$(($mem * 1000))
                export TIMESTAMP=`date +2%3y%m%d_%H%M%S` && bsub -o $TIMESTAMP.out -e $TIMESTAMP.err -C0 -R "select[ncpus>=$n && mem>$mem] rusage[mem=$mem] span[hosts=1]" -M$hmem -q hugemem -n $n "/nfs/acari/avilella/src/mcl-08-152/src/shmcl/mcl ~/family_56/family_56.tcx -I 2.1 -t $n -tf 'gq(50)' -scheme 6 -o ~/family_56/family_56.mcl.turing.gq50.6.$n.$mem.$TIMESTAMP"
                done
done

# Once you have one of the jobs running, kill the remaining pending jobs with "bkill jobid".
#


# After this step is done, rename the file with the funky long name into family_56.mcl
#
#

# to save space
#
bsub 'gzip family_56.tcx'
#
# took 16 minutes in rel.55


10- Load into compara database
    ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

# Fix the Uniprot descriptions if it has not been done during loading

# This takes around an hour, and you can not do anything else before the loading is completed.
