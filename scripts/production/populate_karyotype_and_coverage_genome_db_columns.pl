=head1 DESCRIPTION

This script is used to populate the new "has_karyotype" and "is_high_coverage"
fields of the genome_db table. Most likely, you will need to run this script
only once, on your master
database.
Make sure that you have patched the schema before running the script !

It is advised to first run the script with the "-dry_run 1" option and to
inspect the list of found karyotypes / coverages.

The scripts tries to update all the species that have assembly_default=1
