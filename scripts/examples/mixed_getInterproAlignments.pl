    ## OK, this is a complex RegEx. Mainly the idea is to capture the bit of the aligned
    ## sequence that accounts for the first START nucleotides and the bit of the aligned
    ## sequence that accounts for the following LENGTH nucleotides. Here is a step-by-step
    ## explanation:
    ## 1. (?:\-*\w\-*) where (?:....) means clustering, not capturing. This means one
    ##     nucleotide with whatever number of gaps before or after
    ## 2. (?:\-*\w\-*){$start} This means $start nucleotides with whatever number of
    ##     gaps before, after or in-between
    ## 3. ((?:\-*\w\-*){$start}) Capture $start nucleotides with whatever number of
    ##     gaps before, after or in-between
    ## 4. ((?:\-*\w\-*){$start}) The same for $length
    my ($pre, $this) = $alignment =~ /((?:\-*\w\-*){$start})((?:\-*\w\-*){$length})/;
    ## Now we have in $pre as many nucleotides as defined by $start and whatever number
    ## of gaps. The InterPro domains starts just after this $pre and lasts until the end
    ## of $this. Save the lengths of these regions and exit the loop:
    $aln_start = length($pre);
    $aln_length = length($this);
    last;
  }

  ## Use the start and end coordinates of the domain on the alignment to trim the alignment:
  foreach my $this_leaf (@{$tree->get_all_leaves}) {
    my $alignment = $this_leaf->alignment_string;
    print ">", $this_leaf->gene_member->stable_id, "\n";
    print substr($alignment, $aln_start, $aln_length), "\n";
  }
