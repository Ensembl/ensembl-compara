package previous;

### Provides the PREV psudo-class syntax for calling a method,
### a class function or a sub-routine from the core web code (or
### a previous plugin) from  inside a plugin that is overrdding
### the method/sub-routine.
###
### Working depends on the way plugins are loaded, see LoadPlugins
###
### Usage:
### package EnsEMBL::Web::SomeClass; # core webcode
### use strict;
### sub new {
###   return bless {}, shift;
### }
### 1;
###
### package EnsEMBL::Web::SomeClass; # inside plugins
### use strict;
### use previous qw(new);
### sub new {
###   my $self = shift->PREV::new(@_);
###   // do something to the object before returning it
###   return $self;
### }
###
### Just like SUPER, PREV is resolved from the package where the
### call is made. It is not resolved based on the object's class.
###
### Unlike SUPER, PREV can also be used on a class function or
### a sub-routine, and usage is like below:
###
### package EnsEMBL::Web::SomeUtility; # inside plugins
### use strict;
### use previous qw(my_sub);
### sub my_sub {
###   my $result = PREV::my_sub(); # use the core webcode function
###   // do something else
###   return $result;
### }
###
### The call to the method gets transfered to a method with the
### given name that is found first declared in the list of
### previous plugins or the core web code in the same class or
### any of it's parents.
###

    # that they don't get overwritten by the new methods
    # which will be declared further in the plugin file (the
    # one that is calling 'use previous qw(methods)').
    # Since we need to remember these old methods' names to
    # call them in future, the copied method is given
    # a prefix that corresponds to the plugin it's being
    # modified in. Thus all the methods in all the packages
    # that are being renamed in one plugin will have a same
    # prefix, but different from methods being renamed in
    # some other plugin.
