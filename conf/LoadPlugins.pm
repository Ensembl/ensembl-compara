package LoadPlugins;

### Adds a subroutine in the @INC array that gets called everytime a file is 'require'd.
### The subroutine checks and loads (in the required order) all the files related to the package being required from the plugin directries after loading the core file
### SiteDefs MUST be used somewhere in the codebase before LoadPlugins is used since it needs to know about the ENSEMBL_LIB_DIRS and ENSEMBL_PLUGINS.
