# Release Coordinator, please update this file before starting every release
# and check the changes back into GIT for everyone's benefit.

# Things that normally need updating are:
#
# 1. Release number
# 2. Check the name prefix of all databases
# 3. Possibly add entries for core databases that are still on genebuilders' servers
