"""File comparison methods for different file formats.

This module provides a main file comparison method, :meth:`file_cmp()`, that compares two files and returns
True if they are equivalent, False otherwise. The comparison is made differently depending on the file format.
For instance, two Newick files are considered equal if one tree is the result of a permutation of the other.

Typical usage examples::

    file_cmp('a/homo_sapiens.fa', 'b/homo_sapiens.fa')

    from pathlib import Path
    file_cmp(Path('a', 'tree1.nw'), Path('b', 'tree2.nw'))
