This file describes how to create an image with our species tree.

First, we need to place in all the sub-trees for which we have accurrate
branch lengths (they come from the multiple alignments + phylofit)

perl munge_species_trees.pl ../../scripts/pipeline/species_tree.ensembl.topology.nw ../../scripts/pipeline/species_tree.*.branch_len.nw > species_tree.nw

Open Dendroscope. Load the file and select the Radial Phylogram (Ctrl+7).
- Select everything (Ctrl+A) and change the font size to 12 ("Edit" > "Format")
- In the view menu, deselect "Sparse labels" and choose "Radial labels".
- Adjust the tree, by rotating it left or right.
- Rotate nodes with Ctrl+Shift+T if you wish

If you want to let Dendroscope load the figures automatically, do:
cd ~/src/public-plugins/ensembl/htdocs/i/species/48/
git pull
mkdir ~/tmp/species_tree_imgs
ls *.png | while read i; do \
  cp $i ~/tmp/species_tree_imgs/$i; done
And go to Options -> Load Taxon Images...
You can change the size of the images to 24 in Options -> Set Image Size...

Save the file as an SVG and edit it to replace the images / labels as they usually overlap one another.

Tips:
1. Use inkscape (from the GNOME project) for relocation the taxa images. Use Ctrl+Shift+G to ungroup all in order to move the images freely.
2. Add "Image obtained using Dendroscope (D.H. Huson and C Scornavacca, Dendroscope 3: An interactive tool for rooted phylogenetic trees and networks, Systematic Biology, 2012)" at the bottom of the image
3. Shrink the drawing area to about 1200x900
4. Export the image into a PDF ("File" > "Save a Copy") and into a PNG ("File" > "Export Bitmap")

Commit the SVG, PDF and PNG in this directory.

To get the PDF accessible from the webpage, you must also commit the PDF file into
public-plugins/ensembl/htdocs/info/about/ (Check that the file is there and email the webteam otherwise).
