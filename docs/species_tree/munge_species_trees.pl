=head1 USAGE

Usage: munge_species_trees.pl ref_tree.nw tree_with_bl1.nw tree_with_bl2.nw tree_with_bl3.nw

The script will replace subtrees of the reference tree with the other trees passed as arguments.
The distances of the reference tree are reset to .1, and then overridden by the other trees.
The topologies are supposed to be exactly the same.
