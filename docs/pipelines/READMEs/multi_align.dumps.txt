This README describes how to run the DumpMultiAlign pipeline 

The dumps are grouped by the toplevel regions of the reference species. Alignments not containing the reference species are written to files called *.others_*. Each file contains split_size alignments (default 200). Alignments containing duplications in the reference species are dumped once per duplicated segment.

All the scripts are located relative to $ENSEMBL_CVS_ROOT_DIR (location of the cvs checkout)

1) Edit $ENSEMBL_CVS_ROOT_DIR/ensembl-compara/modules/Bio/EnsEMBL/Compara/PipeConfig/DumpMultiAlign_conf.pm
The location of the compara and core databases containing the alignments can be defined either using the parameter 'db_urls' or 'reg_conf' and 'compara_db'. Defaults have been set in the DumpMultiAlign_conf.pm. Most options likely to change are done on the command line.

Options most likely to need chaging are:
mlss_id     => it is recommended this is changed on the command line
release     => ensembl release
ensembl_cvs_root_dir => location of ensembl cvs root directory

pipeline_db               => production database
staging_loc1,staging_loc1 => current ensembl core databases
livemirror_loc		  => location of previous release core databases
db_urls			  => location of core and optionally, compara databases
reg_conf		  => ensembl registry configuration file to define location of core and optionally, compara databases
compara_db		  => can either be a compara database name eg "Multi", "ensembl_compara_65" or a url eg mysql://user:pass@host:Port/db_name. The default set to "Multi" and uses the db_urls to define the staging servers containing the core and compara database.
coord_system_name1        => "chromosome" or equivalent
coord_system_name2        => "supercontig" or equivalent
format			  => output format. Can be any format supported by the 


2) Run init_pipeline.pl
eg
init_pipeline.pl Bio::EnsEMBL::Compara::PipeConfig::DumpMultiAlign_conf --password **** --mlss_id 548 --output_dir /lustre/scratch101/ensembl/kb3/scratch/hive/release_65/emf_dumps/epo_6_primate --species human -dbname dumpMultiAlign_6way_primate_65 -pipeline_name DUMP_6_65

mlss_id       => method_link_species_set id of the data to be dumped. To dump conservation scores, use the GERP_CONSERVATION_SCORE method_link_species_set id
output_dir    => location of where to write dump files
species       => reference species. 
dbname        => compara database for the pipeline
pipeline_name => unique name for jobs
