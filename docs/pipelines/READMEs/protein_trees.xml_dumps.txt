Compara.{release}.protein.allhomologies.orthoxml.xml.gz
  Contains all the orthologies in a single OrthoXML file. Each orthology is
  stored as an orthologGroup containing two genes.

Compara.{release}.protein.alltrees.orthoxml.xml.gz
  Contains all the trees in a single OrthoXML file. All the trees are
  attached to the root 'groups' tag.

Compara.{release}.protein.alltrees_possorthol.orthoxml.xml.gz
  Also contains all the trees in a single OrthoXML file, but the duplication
  nodes with a confidence score lower than 0.25 are considered as speciations.
  This makes the gene tree inconsistent with the species tree, but the derived
  orthologies include the 'possible_orthologs'.


The following three files are tar archives containing one file per tree.
CAUTION: Be aware that untaring any of these files will create in your current
	   directory more than 19,000 files !

Compara.{release}.protein.tree.orthoxml.tar.gz
  Each file will contain one tree, in OrthoXML format.

Compara.{release}.protein.tree_possorthol.orthoxml.tar.gz
  Each file will contain one tree, in OrthoXML format. Here again, duplication
  nodes with a low confidence score are edited.

Compara.{release}.protein.tree.phyloxml.tar.gz
  Each file will contain one tree, in PhyloXML format.
