  COMPARA PRODUCTION CYCLE
============================


#============================================================================
#  Intentions (declaration of intentions)
#============================================================================

1. Once the release coordinator has sent the mail for declaration of
intention, ask the other members of compara group (or related) what
they intend to produce. Sometimes, you have to wait a bit that gene
builders do their declaration first to know what compara will need to
produce and also potential schema changes. Compara has one extra day
to send the DOI, because we have to know which new species are added.

2. Submit the declaration of intentions using the http://admin.ensembl.org/ website.
Remember that compara has one additional day after the declaration of intentions deadline for the genebuilders.

3. Set up a web page with intentions in the Confluence wiki system to
allow easy tracking of the progress.

Note: The current (rel.64) compara_master database is sf5_ensembl_compara_master on compara1 

#============================================================================
# Important environment variables to be set
#============================================================================

4.1  As many example scripts/files in this document are given relative to $ENSEMBL_CVS_ROOT_DIR,
    make sure this variable is defined in your terminal
    (it is now necessary to run the Hive, so should be in your shell configs).

4.2 Also please make sure that you have set your shell's environment variable $ENSADMIN_PSW
    to the mysql password of 'ensadmin' user.


#============================================================================
# NCBI taxonomy data (handover to compara)
#============================================================================

5.1 Update the NCBI taxonomy local "mirror". Follow the instructions in
    $ENSEMBL_CVS_ROOT_DIR/ensembl-compara/scripts/taxonomy/README-taxonomy
to run a mini Hive pipeline that does everything (you'll have to review/edit a couple of files before that).
The execution of the pipeline normally takes about 2.5-3h.

# rel.64: 2.7 hours


5.2 Update the ncbi_taxa_node and ncbi_taxa_name in the master DB using the
ncbi_taxonomy database located in mysql://ens-livemirror:3306/ncbi_taxonomy
This may be done by the person who runs the orthologs/paralogs, check with him/her.

time mysqldump -u ensro -h ens-livemirror -P3306 --extended-insert --compress --delayed-insert ncbi_taxonomy \
ncbi_taxa_node ncbi_taxa_name | mysql -u ensadmin -p${ENSADMIN_PSW} -h compara1 sf5_ensembl_compara_master

# rel.60: 1 min
# rel.64: 45 sec

#============================================================================
# Master compara database (handover to compara)
#============================================================================

6.0  Update the registry configuration file $ENSEMBL_CVS_ROOT_DIR/ensembl-compara/scripts/pipeline/production_reg_conf.pl
that will be used throughout the release process.

Make sure to have edited the release numbers, added external core databases and fixed name prefixes.

Then check that file back into the CVS for everyone else to use.


6.1 Add in the master compara database
(compara1:3306/sf5_ensembl_compara_master) the new entries in the
genome_db and dnafrag tables. You can set up your registry and use the
$ENSEMBL_CVS_ROOT_DIR/ensembl-compara/scripts/pipeline/update_genome.pl script. This script
sets the new genome_dbs as the default assemblies.
You have to create new genome_db_id (dnafrag) when it is a new assembly, or a new species. 
Sometimes it's done by the pairwise guys as they want to start building earlier. 

eg. 
perl update_genome.pl --reg_conf $ENSEMBL_CVS_ROOT_DIR/ensembl-compara/scripts/pipeline/production_reg_conf.pl --compara compara_master --species bushbaby

eg.
perl $ENSEMBL_CVS_ROOT_DIR/ensembl-compara/scripts/pipeline/update_genome.pl \
 --reg_conf $ENSEMBL_CVS_ROOT_DIR/ensembl-compara/scripts/pipeline/production_reg_conf.pl \
 --compara compara_master --species "Ochotona princeps"

6.2 Add in extra non-reference patches 

To add extra non-reference patches to an assembly, eg human, you need the -force option to just add those dnafrags which aren't already in the database.

perl $ENSEMBL_CVS_ROOT_DIR/ensembl-compara/scripts/pipeline/update_genome.pl --reg_conf $ENSEMBL_CVS_ROOT_DIR/ensembl-compara/scripts/pipeline/production_reg_conf.pl \
        --compara compara_master --species human --force


7. New method_link_species_set entries might be added using the
$ENSEMBL_CVS_ROOT_DIR/ensembl-compara/scripts/pipeline/create_mlss.pl script. The release
coordinator (or any team member) should create a new
method_link_species_set in the master database before starting a new
pipeline in order to get a unique method_link_species_set_id. Ideally
they can be created before starting to build the new database although
new method_link_species_sets can be added later on.
Sometimes the DNA alignment guys add the MLSS themselves. 
For the homologies this is done by the homologues guys

eg. for the pairwise alignment
 perl create_mlss.pl --method_link_type  BLASTZ_NET --genome_db_id 22,51 --source "ensembl" \
        --reg_conf $ENSEMBL_CVS_ROOT_DIR/ensembl-compara/scripts/pipeline/production_reg_conf.pl --compara compara_master

# --pw stands for all pairwised genome_db_ids in the list provided
# --sg stands for keep genome_db_id in the list alone (singleton) 



7.1. Create MLSS entries for homology side pipelines:

## generate the species_set and check it :

    export ALL_GENOMEDB_IDS=`mysql -hcompara1 -uensro sf5_ensembl_compara_master -N -e "select group_concat(genome_db_id order by genome_db_id) from genome_db where (assembly_default=1 and taxon_id!=0)" | cat`
    echo $ALL_GENOMEDB_IDS


## choose a temp. directory where the output will be generated:

    export MLSS_DIR="/tmp/mlss_creation"
    mkdir $MLSS_DIR


## run the loading script several times:

# orthologues
echo -e "201\n" | perl $ENSEMBL_CVS_ROOT_DIR/ensembl-compara/scripts/pipeline/create_mlss.pl --f \
--reg_conf $ENSEMBL_CVS_ROOT_DIR/ensembl-compara/scripts/pipeline/production_reg_conf.pl \
--pw --genome_db_id "$ALL_GENOMEDB_IDS" 1>$MLSS_DIR/create_mlss.ENSEMBL_ORTHOLOGUES.201.out 2>$MLSS_DIR/create_mlss.ENSEMBL_ORTHOLOGUES.201.err

# paralogues btw
echo -e "202\n" | perl $ENSEMBL_CVS_ROOT_DIR/ensembl-compara/scripts/pipeline/create_mlss.pl --f \
--reg_conf $ENSEMBL_CVS_ROOT_DIR/ensembl-compara/scripts/pipeline/production_reg_conf.pl \
--pw --genome_db_id "$ALL_GENOMEDB_IDS" 1>$MLSS_DIR/create_mlss.ENSEMBL_PARALOGUES.btw.202.out 2>$MLSS_DIR/create_mlss.ENSEMBL_PARALOGUES.btw.202.err

# paralogues wth
echo -e "202\n" | perl $ENSEMBL_CVS_ROOT_DIR/ensembl-compara/scripts/pipeline/create_mlss.pl --f \
--reg_conf $ENSEMBL_CVS_ROOT_DIR/ensembl-compara/scripts/pipeline/production_reg_conf.pl \
--sg --genome_db_id "$ALL_GENOMEDB_IDS" 1>$MLSS_DIR/create_mlss.ENSEMBL_PARALOGUES.wth.202.out 2>$MLSS_DIR/create_mlss.ENSEMBL_PARALOGUES.wth.202.err

# proteintrees
echo -e "401\n" | perl $ENSEMBL_CVS_ROOT_DIR/ensembl-compara/scripts/pipeline/create_mlss.pl --f \
--reg_conf $ENSEMBL_CVS_ROOT_DIR/ensembl-compara/scripts/pipeline/production_reg_conf.pl \
--name "protein trees" --genome_db_id "$ALL_GENOMEDB_IDS" 1>$MLSS_DIR/create_mlss.PROTEIN_TREES.401.out 2>$MLSS_DIR/create_mlss.PROTEIN_TREES.401.err

# nctrees
echo -e "402\n" | perl $ENSEMBL_CVS_ROOT_DIR/ensembl-compara/scripts/pipeline/create_mlss.pl --f \
--reg_conf $ENSEMBL_CVS_ROOT_DIR/ensembl-compara/scripts/pipeline/production_reg_conf.pl \
--name "nc trees" --genome_db_id "$ALL_GENOMEDB_IDS" 1>$MLSS_DIR/create_mlss.NC_TREES.402.out 2>$MLSS_DIR/create_mlss.NC_TREES.402.err

# families
echo -e "301\n" | perl $ENSEMBL_CVS_ROOT_DIR/ensembl-compara/scripts/pipeline/create_mlss.pl --f \
--reg_conf $ENSEMBL_CVS_ROOT_DIR/ensembl-compara/scripts/pipeline/production_reg_conf.pl \
--name "families" --genome_db_id "$ALL_GENOMEDB_IDS" 1>$MLSS_DIR/create_mlss.FAMILY.301.out 2>$MLSS_DIR/create_mlss.FAMILY.301.err



## if output/error files are ok, remove them all:

    rm -rf $MLSS_DIR

## ,otherwise *PANIC*


7.2. Update the species_set_tags.
Run the script: update_species_sets.pl

eg
perl $ENSEMBL_CVS_ROOT_DIR/ensembl-compara/scripts/pipeline/update_species_sets.pl \
    --conf $ENSEMBL_CVS_ROOT_DIR/ensembl-compara/scripts/pipeline/production_reg_conf.pl --dbname compara_master > update_species_sets.out 2> update_species_sets.err


# Add/Update any dna tags if necessary. There should be a tag for each of the multiple alignments.
# Note that fish will already have had a species_set_tag added by the above script.

# 6way epo
INSERT INTO species_set_tag (species_set_id, tag,value) VALUES (33896,"name","primates");

# 12way epo
INSERT INTO species_set_tag (species_set_id, tag,value) VALUES (33895,"name","mammals");

# 19way mercator/pecan
INSERT INTO species_set_tag (species_set_id, tag,value) VALUES (33898,"name","amniotes");

# 35way low coverage
INSERT INTO species_set_tag (species_set_id, tag,value) VALUES (33899,"name","mammals");

#
# TODO: create_mlss should perform this insert if --species_set_name option has been provided on the command line
#
 

7.3. Wait for the handover before starting to build the new database in case
any of the new species cannot make it. Don't forget to switch the
assembly_default values of genome_db in this case.
 [1] for species making it / used in the pipeline
 [0] for species not making it / or old assemblies


8. Create the new database for the new release and add it to your
registry configuration file. Use the $ENSEMBL_CVS_ROOT_DIR/ensembl-compara/sql/table.sql
file to create the tables and populate the database with the relevant
primary data and genomic alignments that can be reused from the
previous release. This can be done with the
$ENSEMBL_CVS_ROOT_DIR/ensembl-compara/scripts/pipeline/populate_new_database.pl script.  It
requires the master database, the previous released database and the
fresh new database with the tables already created. The script will
copy relevant data from the master and the old database into the new
one. 

mysql --defaults-group-suffix=_compara4 -e "CREATE DATABASE lg4_ensembl_compara_64"
mysql --defaults-group-suffix=_compara4 lg4_ensembl_compara_64 < $ENSEMBL_CVS_ROOT_DIR/ensembl-compara/sql/table.sql

# Before you start copying, make a dry run of the populate_new_database.pl with -intentions flag to review the list of mlss_ids to be copied:

$ENSEMBL_CVS_ROOT_DIR/ensembl-compara/scripts/pipeline/populate_new_database.pl \
    --reg-conf $ENSEMBL_CVS_ROOT_DIR/ensembl-compara/scripts/pipeline/production_reg_conf.pl --master compara_master --old compara_prev --new compara_curr --intentions

# (takes about a minute and produces a long list)

# If you believe some of the entries should NOT be copied, you should manually add 'skip_mlss' and 'skip_ss' entries into master_db's meta table.

# Now run the copying process (takes ~3 hours on a sunny day)

time $ENSEMBL_CVS_ROOT_DIR/ensembl-compara/scripts/pipeline/populate_new_database.pl \
    --reg-conf $ENSEMBL_CVS_ROOT_DIR/ensembl-compara/scripts/pipeline/production_reg_conf.pl --master compara_master --old compara_prev --new compara_curr

# took 3 hours for rel.pre57 (copied from rel.56)
# took 3 hours for rel.57 (copied from rel.pre57)
# took 2:15 hours for rel.58 (copied from rel.57)
# took 2:09 hours for rel.59 (copied from rel.58)
# took 3 hours for rel. 60 (copied from rel.59)
# rel.64:   2.6h

If new method_link_species_sets are added in the master after this, you use this
script again to copy the new relevant data. In such case, you will have to skip
the old_database in order to avoid trying to copy the dna-dna alignments and
syntenies again.

$ENSEMBL_CVS_ROOT_DIR/ensembl-compara/scripts/pipeline/populate_new_database.pl \
    --reg-conf $ENSEMBL_CVS_ROOT_DIR/ensembl-compara/scripts/pipeline/production_reg_conf.pl --master compara_master --new compara_curr


8.1. Copy the species_set_tag table -- CAREFUL: this may have generated the species_set_tag mess we have in rel.63!
This needs to be added to the populate_new_database script and not just copied from the master where all old tags need to be deleted.
But copy from master till this is done.
INSERT INTO species_set_tag SELECT * FROM sf5_ensembl_compara_master.species_set_tag;


8.2. Add new species to phylogenetic tree
The easiest way to use this is to use the phylowidget.
From the EnsEMBL home page:
View full list of all Ensembl species
Species tree (Requires Java)

Select Arrow and select where you want the new species to go (use ncbi taxonomy or wikipedia etc) eg  Canis familiaris
Tree Edit
Add
Sister

Click on empty node
Edit Name (add new name)

The tree should appear in the Toolbox but if not, then save the tree
Copy the new tree into
    $ENSEMBL_CVS_ROOT_DIR/ensembl-compara/scripts/pipeline/species_tree_blength.nh
cvs commit

9. Check that primary data (species data, dnafrags...) in the new compara DB
match the data in the corresponding core databases using the healthchecks. You
may have to edit the ensj-healthcheck/database.properties file. It should look
like this:

    host=compara1
    port=3306
    user=ensadmin
    password=***********

    # Database driver class - shouldn't need to be changed
    driver=org.gjt.mm.mysql.Driver

    # Master schema - see CompareSchema healthcheck
    # This setting is ignored if CompareSchema is not run
    master.schema=master_schema_38

    # Secondary database connection details
    secondary.host=ecs2
    secondary.port=3364
    secondary.user=ensro
    secondary.driver=org.gjt.mm.mysql.Driver


Make sure everything is up to date:
cd ensj-healthcheck
cvs update -Pd

Recompile:
export JAVA_HOME=/software/jdk
bsub -Is ant

Now you can run the compara-compara_external_foreign_keys healthchecks:

time ./run-healthcheck.sh -d lg4_ensembl_compara_64 -type compara -d2 .+_core_64_.+ compara_external_foreign_keys

...and correct mismatches if any!


#============================================================================
# Merging (pre-compara handover)
#============================================================================

10. Merge data.

10.0 Human patches for high coverage blastz-net alignments

         # Find all the relevant mlss_ids:
     export AFFECTED_MLSSS=`mysql --defaults-group-suffix=_compara1 kb3_hsap_lastz_hap_64 -N -e "select group_concat(distinct(method_link_species_set_id) SEPARATOR ' ') from genomic_align join dnafrag using (dnafrag_id) where genome_db_id=90 and method_link_species_set_id<1000"`

        # Use the --merge option of copy_data:
     time for i in $AFFECTED_MLSSS; do echo $i; $ENSEMBL_CVS_ROOT_DIR/ensembl-compara/scripts/pipeline/copy_data.pl --from_url mysql://ensro@compara1/kb3_hsap_lastz_hap_64 --to_url mysql://ensadmin:${ENSADMIN_PSW}@compara4/lg4_ensembl_compara_64 --mlss $i --merge; done

# rel.64: 1h (13 affected mlsss)


10.1 TRANSLATED_BLAT_NET, BlastZ-Net, Pecan, Gerp

    The removal of old data shouldn't be necessary unless the skip_mlss entries are not up to date.
    Removal of old data :
        # constrained elements are removed directly by mlss_id OF THE CONSTRAINED_ELEMENT:
            DELETE FROM constrained_element WHERE method_link_species_set_id=CE_MLSS_ID;

        # conservation_scores can only be removed by gab_id, which can be done together with gabs:
            DELETE gab, cs FROM genomic_align_block gab LEFT JOIN conservation_score cs ON gab.genomic_align_block_id=cs.genomic_align_block_id \
                WHERE gab.method_link_species_set_id=Main_MLSS_ID;

        # genomic_align_trees and genomic_align_groups are linked to genomic_aligns:
            DELETE ga, gag, gat FROM genomic_align ga LEFT JOIN genomic_align_group gag ON ga.genomic_align_id=gag.genomic_align_id \
                LEFT JOIN genomic_align_tree gat ON gag.node_id=gat.node_id \
                WHERE ga.method_link_species_set_id=Main_MLSS_ID;
        # in rel.pre57 didn't cleanly remove all gat entries, please check by node_id range.

    These data are usually in separate production databases. You can copy them using the
    $ENSEMBL_CVS_ROOT_DIR/ensembl-compara/scripts/pipeline/copy_data.pl script.
    This script requires write access to the production database if the dnafrag_ids need fixing
    or the data must be copied in binary mode (this is required for conservation scores).
    Example:
          bsub -q yesterday -R "select[mem>5000] rusage[mem=5000]" -M5000000 \
            -I time $ENSEMBL_CVS_ROOT_DIR/ensembl-compara/scripts/pipeline/copy_data.pl \
            --from_url mysql://ensadmin:${ENSADMIN_PSW}@host/production_db \
            --to_url mysql://ensadmin:${ENSADMIN_PSW}@host/release_db --mlss 268

    Note_1: bear in mind that even though constrained elements and conservation scores are associated
    with a multiple alignment, they are not copied automatically and have their own mlss_id,
    so you should copy them by a separate execution of copy_data.

#    Note_2: for copying conservation scores you have to provide rw_user and password for --from_url,
#    because the script needs to write into the production database.
#
#    Note_3: multiple alignments THAT PRODUCE ANCESTRAL SEQUENCES (not all of them do) eg EPO alignments, will also need
#    the ancestral sequences copying to the core ancestral database. The copy_data script has been altered to automatically copy 
#    the ancestral dnafrags into the compara database.
#
#    Note_4: for multiple alignments that SHOULD HAVE BEEN automatically copied from the prev.release,
#    check that you have the ancestral dnafrags copied. Again this should now happen automatically.

10.2 Syntenies

  Please refer to the documentation in the $ENSEMBL_CVS_ROOT_DIR/ensembl-compara/script/synteny directory.

    1) First make sure the entries in $ENSEMBL_CVS_ROOT_DIR/ensembl-compara/scripts/pipeline/production_reg_conf.pl file
        point at the latest (staging) versions of the core databases.
    
    2) Then run something like:
    $ENSEMBL_CVS_ROOT_DIR/ensembl-compara/scripts/synteny/LoadSyntenyData.pl --reg_conf $ENSEMBL_CVS_ROOT_DIR/ensembl-compara/scripts/pipeline/production_reg_conf.pl \
        --dbname compara_curr -qy "Homo sapiens" -tg "Callithrix jacchus" \
        /lustre/scratch101/ensembl/kb3/scratch/hive/release_64/kb3_hsap_cjac_synteny_64/synteny/all.100000.100000.BuildSynteny

    3) Check that the MLSS object in the method_link_species_set is fully defined (the loading script may need fixing?)

======================================


10.3 Putting together the database of ancestral sequence is now done using a dedicated Hive-Core mini-pipeline:

    Go to $ENSEMBL_CVS_ROOT_DIR/ensembl-compara/modules/Bio/EnsEMBL/Compara/PipeConfig and open the PipeConfig file AncestralMerge_conf.pm .

    Make sure you have edited/checked the following:
        1) current release number
        2) names and locations of current and previous ancestral core databases
        3) the table of ancestral sequence sources in the second analysis (some entries might point to the previous release ancestral database, some will be new)

    Save the changes, exit the editor and run init_pipeline.pl with this file:
        init_pipeline.pl AncestralMerge_conf.pm -password $ENSADMIN_PSW

    Then run both -sync and -loop variations of the beekeeper.pl command suggested by init_pipeline.pl .
    This pipeline will merge the separate ancestral core sources into ensembl_ancestral_{rel_number}.
    
    You may want to check the msg table for errors and have a look at the result of the merger:
        SELECT left(name,12) na, count(*), min(seq_region_id), max(seq_region_id), max(seq_region_id)-min(seq_region_id)+1 FROM seq_region GROUP BY na;

    If everything is ok, drop hive-specific tables:
        CALL drop_hive_tables;
        TRUNCATE analysis;

    Make sure all tables are turned into MyISAM (or add a couple of analyses to the pipeline to do it).
    You may need to remove a foreign key in analysis_description before that.

10.4 Merging GeneTrees+Families+NCTrees together is now done by running a mini-pipeline.

10.4.1  Make sure you have performed StableID mapping step on ProteinTrees (done manually)

10.4.2  Make sure you have performed TreeFam mapping step on ProteinTrees (done manually)

10.4.3  Make sure you have mapped "lost taxa" back in Families (should move into the Family pipeline!):
            create temporary table lost_taxa SELECT distinct member.taxon_id FROM member LEFT JOIN ncbi_taxa_name ON member.taxon_id = ncbi_taxa_name.taxon_id WHERE ncbi_taxa_name.taxon_id iS NULL;
            create temporary table lost_taxa_mapping select name as was_id, taxon_id as became_id from ncbi_taxa_name where name_class='merged_taxon_id' and name in (select taxon_id from lost_taxa);
            update member m join lost_taxa_mapping l on m.taxon_id=l.was_id set m.taxon_id=l.became_id;

10.4.4  Actually perform the merging step:

    Go to $ENSEMBL_CVS_ROOT_DIR/ensembl-compara/modules/Bio/EnsEMBL/Compara/PipeConfig and open the PipeConfig file MergeHomologySideTogether_conf.pm
    
    It has 6 sections for connecting to databases where you will have to change the names of the databases and possibly their locations:
        pipeline_db  - is your intermediate target (all protein side pipelines merged together)
        master_db    - is the main compara master
        prevrel_db   - should point to the previous release database
        genetrees_db - should point to the current GeneTrees pipeline database
        families_db  - should point to the current Families pipeline database
        nctrees_db   - should point to the current ncRNAtrees pipeline database

    Save the changes, exit the editor and run init_pipeline.pl with this file:
        init_pipeline.pl MergeHomologySideTogether_conf.pm -password $ENSADMIN_PSW

    Then run both -sync and -loop variations of the beekeeper.pl command suggested by init_pipeline.pl .
    This pipeline will create a database with protein side pipeline databases merged together.


10.5 Final merger of "protein side" into the release database is done by running another mini-pipeline.

    Go to (or stay in) $ENSEMBL_CVS_ROOT_DIR/ensembl-compara/modules/Bio/EnsEMBL/Compara/PipeConfig and open the PipeConfig file MergeHomologyIntoRelease_conf.pm
    
    It has 3 sections for connecting to databases where you will have to change the names of the databases and possibly their locations:
        pipeline_db        - is a hive database that is only used for job tracking - it may/should be removed right after the pipeline is done
        merged_homology_db - is the result of the previous step (protein side databases merged together)
        rel_db             - is the main release database

    Save the changes, exit the editor and run init_pipeline.pl with this file:
        init_pipeline.pl MergeHomologyIntoRelease_conf.pm -password $ENSADMIN_PSW -hive_driver sqlite

    Then run both -sync and -loop variations of the beekeeper.pl command suggested by init_pipeline.pl .
    This pipeline will merge the protein side tables into the main release database.


10.6 Cleanup and CVS commit

    After you are happy about the result of both mergers
    you can drop both "compara_homology_merged" and "compara_full_merge" databases.

    Also, please commit the changes to the PipeConfig files that you have made.


11. Drop method_link_species_set entries for alignments which did not make it.

11.5 Check for method_links that do not have a corresponding method_link_species_set:
    SELECT ml.* FROM method_link ml LEFT JOIN method_link_species_set mlss ON ml.method_link_id=mlss.method_link_id WHERE mlss.method_link_id IS NULL;
In most cases they can be removed, but check with other members of Compara.

Removal of redundant method_link entries:
    DELETE ml FROM method_link ml LEFT JOIN method_link_species_set mlss ON ml.method_link_id=mlss.method_link_id WHERE mlss.method_link_id IS NULL;


12. Updating member.display_label and member.description fields for the members generated by EnsEMBL prediction.

This step has to happen ASAP, but AFTER the Core name projections have been done. And before you analyze/optimize the tables.
(1. Matthieu/Leo runs the Homology pipeline
 2. The homology database is given to Rhoda, who uses it to run name projections on Core databases (display_labels and gene_descriptions change in Core databases)
 3. We use the information in Core databases (derived from Homology, i.e. Compara) to fix the display_labels and gene_descriptions for Compara
!MAKE SURE YOU ARE IN SYNC WITH THE REST OF THE WORLD!
)

I made a backup of the member table before starting:
RENAME TABLE member TO member_orig;
CREATE TABLE member LIKE member_orig;
INSERT INTO member SELECT * FROM member_orig;

12.1 Ensure your registry is correct

The registry file which is used should point to the server where all updated
Xref projections are located. This will mean staging servers 1 and 2. To load
the data from these two servers you can use the 
Bio::EnsEMBL::Registry->load_registry_from_multiple_dbs() call on both servers.

12.2 Run the command

# NB: Please note that your --compara_db will have to be set to the database where you want to perform the member update;
#     in the following example it is the result of intermediate merger of homology databases, but in most cases will probably be the final release database.

# To update member display_labels of the intermediate result of the merger:
time standaloneJob.pl Bio::EnsEMBL::Compara::RunnableDB::MemberDisplayLabelUpdater --reg_conf $ENSEMBL_CVS_ROOT_DIR/ensembl-compara/scripts/pipeline/production_reg_conf.pl --compara_db compara_homology_merged --debug 1
# rel.64    12m

# Or, if you do not have the 'compara_homology_merged' in the Registry, you can specify compara_db using an URL:
time standaloneJob.pl Bio::EnsEMBL::Compara::RunnableDB::MemberDisplayLabelUpdater --reg_conf $ENSEMBL_CVS_ROOT_DIR/ensembl-compara/scripts/pipeline/production_reg_conf.pl --compara_db mysql://ensadmin:${ENSADMIN_PSW}@compara3:3306/lg4_compara_homology_merged_64 --debug 1

# An old way of doing the same thing (before we had standaloneJob.pl) was to run a dedicated script:
# bsub -o populate_member_display_labels.out -e populate_member_display_labels.err -R "select[mem>5000] rusage[mem=5000]" -M5000000 time perl $ENSEMBL_CVS_ROOT_DIR/ensembl-compara/scripts/pipeline/populate_member_display_labels.pl --reg_conf $ENSEMBL_CVS_ROOT_DIR/ensembl-compara/scripts/pipeline/production_reg_conf.pl --reg_alias compara_curr --verbose
# rel59 real    9m44.754s
# rel60 real    10m23.002s
# rel62 real    11m
# rel63 real    11m

This will iterate over all GenomeDBs and update any label which is empty. Should
you wish to replace existing labels then rerun with the -replace switch. 

Ran a few tests:

mysql -hcompara1 -uensro kb3_ensembl_compara_60 -e "select count(*) from member_orig mo, member m where m.member_id=mo.member_id and m.display_label IS NOT NULL and mo.display_label IS NULL"
+----------+
| count(*) |
+----------+
|  1278014 |
+----------+

mysql -hens-livemirror -uensro ensembl_compara_59 -e "select stable_id, display_label from member m where m.display_label IS NOT NULL" | sort > 59.display_label.tsv 
mysql -hcompara1 -uensro kb3_ensembl_compara_60 -e "select stable_id,display_label from member m where m.display_label IS NOT NULL" | sort > 60.display_label.tsv 
join 59.display_label.tsv 60.display_label.tsv | wc -l
3017840
join -v 1 59.display_label.tsv 60.display_label.tsv | wc -l
42957
join -v 2 59.display_label.tsv 60.display_label.tsv | wc -l
126040

These look fine.

Remember to DROP TABLE member_orig if made a backup.

13. Run the healthchecks:

13.1 Run the healthchecks for ancestral database:

    time ./run-healthcheck.sh -d lg4_ensembl_ancestral_64 compara-ancestral
# rel.62: 4sec, all successful
# rel.63: 14sec, all successful after analyzing 3 tables

13.2 Update the max_alignment_length. You can use the corresponding healthcheck with the -repair option:

    time ./run-healthcheck.sh -d lg4_ensembl_compara_64 -type compara -repair Meta
# rel.61: 6m30, "no repair needed" (probably after Stephen has already done it)
# rel.63: 8m (full repair)

13.3 Now run the remaining healthchecks:

    time ./run-healthcheck.sh -d lg4_ensembl_compara_64 -type compara -d2 .+_core_64_.+ compara_external_foreign_keys
# in rel.56 everything passed apart from CheckTaxon - according to Javier in this particular case it was not a problem
# in rel.pre57 it took 20 minutes (all passed).
# in rel.57 it took ?? minutes ('genbank common name' for 4 species had to be copied from their 'ensembl common name' in ncbi_taxa_name table)
# rel.58:   22m
# rel.61:   32m, 1 failure
# rel.63:   23m, 1 failure ( taeniopygia_guttata_core_63_1: common_name::zebra finch is not in lg4_ensembl_compara_63 )

    time ./run-healthcheck.sh -d lg4_ensembl_compara_64 -type compara compara_genomic
# rel.58:   47m, 7 failures
# rel.61:   51m, 3 failures
# rel.63:   84m, (2.5 errors that are "ok")

    time ./run-healthcheck.sh -d lg4_ensembl_compara_64 -type compara compara_homology
# rel.58:   14m, 5 failures
# rel.61:   30m, 3 failures
# rel.62:   3m, 1 failure (CheckSpeciesSetTag, ok?)
# rel.63:   52m, success (after some fixing, of course)

...and correct mismatches if any!


14. Ask the release coordinator to point the test web server to the compara DB.

Upon confirmation from the release coordinator ask other members of Compara to go to
    http://staging.ensembl.org/
and check their data.


15. Run ANALYZE TABLE and OPTIMIZE TABLE commands for both databases produced
#
# This is required for the CopyDbOverServer script to work properly.
# So if you (suspect that you) have changed anything in the database, do run these two commands just in case -
# a dry run of each doesn't even take a minute.

time mysqlcheck --analyze --verbose --host=compara4 --port=3306 --user=ensadmin --password=$ENSADMIN_PSW --databases lg4_ensembl_compara_64
# rel.56    12min
# rel.pre57 30+105min
# rel.57    9+4+5min
# rel.58    3min

# rel.63    14m


16. WHEN EVERYBODY IS HAPPY ABOUT THE DATABASES, actually copy them to the two staging servers
This is done by a strange script with a clumsy interface, but take heart:

16.1. First, ssh into the DESTINATION machine:

    # NB: ask for the password on staging well in advance - there may be noone around you at the right moment!
ssh mysqlens@ens-staging

    # switch shells, as it is running tcsh by default
bash

16.2. Create a file that will contain one line with the source/destination parameters, like this:

cat <<EOF >/tmp/lg4_ensembl_compara_64.copy_options
#from_host      from_port   from_dbname                 to_host         to_port     to_dbname
#
compara4        3306        lg4_ensembl_compara_64      ens-staging     3306        ensembl_compara_64
compara1        3306        lg4_ensembl_ancestral_64    ens-staging     3306        ensembl_ancestral_64
EOF

16.3. Set the password into the environment variable
    export ENSADMIN_PSW='...'


16.4. Run the script to actually copy the data:

time perl ~lg4/work/ensembl/misc-scripts/CopyDBoverServer.pl -pass $ENSADMIN_PSW \
        -noflush /tmp/lg4_ensembl_compara_64.copy_options > /tmp/lg4_ensembl_compara_64.copy.err 2>&1

# copying of rel_56 took 2 hours (SUCCESSFUL for both databases - you should check the output file)
# copying of ensembl_compara_pre57 took 2 hours (SUCCESSFUL)
# copying of ensembl_compara_57 took 2 hours (SUCCESSFUL)
# copying of ensembl_ancestral_57 took 20 minutes (only SUCCESSFUL after analyzing/optimizing)
# copying of ensembl_compara_58 and ensembl_ancestral_58 together took 1:30h (SUCCESSFUL)
# copying of ensembl_compara_62 and ensembl_ancestral_62 took 2h38
# copying of ensembl_compara_63 and ensembl_ancestral_63 took 2h
# copying of ensembl_compara_64 and ensembl_ancestral_64 took 2h15m


16.4 Do the same thing in parallel on ens-staging2 :

ssh mysqlens@ens-staging2

bash

# NB: the ancestral database doesn't need to be copied to the second staging server

cat <<EOF >/tmp/lg4_ensembl_compara_64.copy_options
#from_host      from_port   from_dbname                 to_host         to_port     to_dbname
#
compara4        3306        lg4_ensembl_compara_64      ens-staging2     3306        ensembl_compara_64
EOF

16.5. Set the password into the environment variable
    export ENSADMIN_PSW='...'

16.6. Run the script to actually copy the data:

time perl ~lg4/work/ensembl/misc-scripts/CopyDBoverServer.pl -pass $ENSADMIN_PSW \
        -noflush /tmp/lg4_ensembl_compara_64.copy_options > /tmp/lg4_ensembl_compara_64.copy.err 2>&1
# copying of ensembl_compara_58 took 1:15h
# copying of ensembl_compara_62 took 1:34h
# copying of ensembl_compara_63 took 3:44h
# copying of ensembl_compara_64 took 3h51m


#### At this point you are "handing over the databases" to the person running Compara Mart (usually Rhoda).
#### Let the main Release Coordinator and Rhoda know about it.
#### But your job is not over yet! Carry on:


17. Dump both the current and the previous release schemas and compare them.

17.1 Create a patch to convert a compara DB from the previous release to the new one.

# The patch should include at least an update of the schema_version in the meta table!
#
mysqldump --defaults-group-suffix=_compara4 --no-data --skip-add-drop-table sf5_ensembl_compara_63 | sed 's/AUTO_INCREMENT=[0-9]*\b//' >old_schema.sql
mysqldump --defaults-group-suffix=_compara4 --no-data --skip-add-drop-table lg4_ensembl_compara_64 | sed 's/AUTO_INCREMENT=[0-9]*\b//' >new_schema.sql
#
sdiff -b old_schema.sql new_schema.sql | less
#
# (create the patch_63_64.sql file by hand)

17.2 Generate an empty database from the old schema, apply the patch, dump it, and check that you get the new schema.

mysql --defaults-group-suffix=_compara4 -e 'create database lg4_schema_patch_test'
mysql --defaults-group-suffix=_compara4 lg4_schema_patch_test < old_schema.sql
mysql --defaults-group-suffix=_compara4 lg4_schema_patch_test < patch_63_64.sql
mysqldump --defaults-group-suffix=_compara4 --no-data --skip-add-drop-table lg4_schema_patch_test | sed 's/AUTO_INCREMENT=[0-9]*\b//' >patched_old_schema.sql
#
sdiff -bs patched_old_schema.sql new_schema.sql | less

17.3 CVS commit the patch.


18. Update the files in the $ENSEMBL_CVS_ROOT_DIR/ensembl-compara/sql directory:

cd $ENSEMBL_CVS_ROOT_DIR/ensembl-compara/sql/

mysql --defaults-group-suffix=_compara4 -N -e "SELECT * FROM genome_db order by genome_db_id asc" lg4_ensembl_compara_64 > genome_db.txt
mysql --defaults-group-suffix=_compara4 -N -e "SELECT * FROM method_link order by method_link_id asc" lg4_ensembl_compara_64 > method_link.txt

# You will have to change the default schema_version in the table.sql file (last line of the file)

# CVS commit these files.


19.1 Update .inc files:

cd $ENSEMBL_CVS_ROOT_DIR/public-plugins/ensembl/htdocs/info/docs/compara

You might need to update the create_mlss_table.conf file with new species added.
Or you can use the order of species given in the species tree:

  $ENSEMBL_CVS_ROOT_DIR/ensembl-compara/docs/create_mlss_table.pl \
    --reg_conf $ENSEMBL_CVS_ROOT_DIR/ensembl-compara/scripts/pipeline/production_reg_conf.pl --reg_alias compara_curr --species_tree_from_db \
    --list --method_link PECAN > pecan.inc

  $ENSEMBL_CVS_ROOT_DIR/ensembl-compara/docs/create_mlss_table.pl \
    --reg_conf $ENSEMBL_CVS_ROOT_DIR/ensembl-compara/scripts/pipeline/production_reg_conf.pl --reg_alias compara_curr --species_tree_from_db \
    --list --method_link EPO > epo.inc

  $ENSEMBL_CVS_ROOT_DIR/ensembl-compara/docs/create_mlss_table.pl \
    --reg_conf $ENSEMBL_CVS_ROOT_DIR/ensembl-compara/scripts/pipeline/production_reg_conf.pl --reg_alias compara_curr --species_tree_from_db \
    --list --method_link EPO_LOW_COVERAGE > epo_lc.inc

  $ENSEMBL_CVS_ROOT_DIR/ensembl-compara/docs/create_mlss_table.pl \
    --reg_conf $ENSEMBL_CVS_ROOT_DIR/ensembl-compara/scripts/pipeline/production_reg_conf.pl --reg_alias compara_curr --species_tree_from_db \
    --list --method_link TRANSLATED_BLAT_NET > tblat_net.inc

# for blastz_net/lastz_net produce a simple list, because the table is getting too big:
  $ENSEMBL_CVS_ROOT_DIR/ensembl-compara/docs/create_mlss_table.pl \
    --reg_conf $ENSEMBL_CVS_ROOT_DIR/ensembl-compara/scripts/pipeline/production_reg_conf.pl --reg_alias compara_curr --species_tree_from_db \
    --blastz_list --method_link BLASTZ_NET --method_link LASTZ_NET > blastz_net.inc

  $ENSEMBL_CVS_ROOT_DIR/ensembl-compara/docs/create_mlss_table.pl \
    --reg_conf $ENSEMBL_CVS_ROOT_DIR/ensembl-compara/scripts/pipeline/production_reg_conf.pl --reg_alias compara_curr --species_tree_from_db \
    --trim --method_link SYNTENY > synteny.inc

CVS commit these files.


19.2 Update pipeline diagrams in the docs:

cd $ENSEMBL_CVS_ROOT_DIR/ensembl-compara/docs/pipeline_diagrams

$ENSEMBL_CVS_ROOT_DIR/ensembl-hive/scripts/generate_graph.pl -url mysql://ensro@compara3/mm14_compara_homology_64 -output ProteinTrees.png
$ENSEMBL_CVS_ROOT_DIR/ensembl-hive/scripts/generate_graph.pl -url mysql://ensro@compara4/mp12_compara_nctrees_64 -output ncRNAtrees.png
$ENSEMBL_CVS_ROOT_DIR/ensembl-hive/scripts/generate_graph.pl -url mysql://ensro@compara2/lg4_compara_families_64 -output Families.png
$ENSEMBL_CVS_ROOT_DIR/ensembl-hive/scripts/generate_graph.pl -url mysql://ensro@compara1/kb3_pecan_19way_64 -output MercatorPecan.png
$ENSEMBL_CVS_ROOT_DIR/ensembl-hive/scripts/generate_graph.pl -url mysql://ensro@compara1/kb3_epo_35way_64 -output EpoLowCoverage.png

CVS commit these files.


20. Update the schema and tutorial documentation files compara_schema.html and compara_tutorial.html in this directory:
    ensembl-webcode/htdocs/info/docs/api/compara/
    (previously - public-plugins/ensembl/htdocs/info/docs/api/compara )

CVS commit the changes.


21. Remind Javier to do the DNA part of the dumps.


22. Run the pipelines for dumping GeneTrees and ncRNAtrees yourself:

22a. Go to $ENSEMBL_CVS_ROOT_DIR/ensembl-compara/modules/Bio/EnsEMBL/Compara/PipeConfig and open the PipeConfig file DumpTrees_conf.pm

    Check that you are happy about all parameters:
        rel             being the current release number (sometimes this is the only thing to change),
        rel_db          pointing at the release database,
        target_dir      suitable for creating and storing the dumps in
    If not happy, edit the changes, save the config file and exit the editor.

    Run init_pipeline.pl with this file:
        init_pipeline.pl DumpTrees_conf.pm -tree_type protein_trees -host compara2
        #
        # rel.64: testing sqlite mode failed: too many occurences of "database locked". We should stick to mysql.

    Then run both -sync and -loop variations of the beekeeper.pl command suggested by init_pipeline.pl .
    This pipeline will produce protein_tree dumps in the directory pointed at by 'target_dir' parameter.

# rel_60: took 5 hours on a "bad lustre" day. On one of such days you're better off pointing at your home directory!
# rel_64: 48m
    
22b. Stay in the same directory, but now create another pipeline from the same config file:
        init_pipeline.pl DumpTrees_conf.pm -tree_type ncrna_trees -host compara2

    Then run both -sync and -loop variations of the beekeeper.pl command suggested by init_pipeline.pl .
    This pipeline will produce ncrna_tree dumps in the directory pointed at by 'target_dir' parameter.

# rel_60: 8m, the other extreme.
# rel_64: 5m

22c. Commit the DumpTrees_conf.pm file into the CVS if you'd like to keep the changes.

22d. Report the locations of the dumps to the main Release Coordinator and/or the web people.
