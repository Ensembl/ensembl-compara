<h1>Troubleshooting your Ensembl Website installation</h1>

<h2 id="whichfile">Which configuration files do I edit?</h2>
<p>
  Ensembl contains a number of ini-files with the same name - why?
</p>
<p>
  Ensembl uses a system of "plugins" to make site configuration and extension
  easier. These are listed in conf/Plugins - generally only the top one, which
  configures your mirror, should be edited. Leave the others alone, as they
   will only be overwritten next time you update the Ensembl webcode.
</p>

<p><a href="/info/docs/webcode/dev/">How plugins work</a>...</p>

<h2 id="accounts">The main Ensembl website has user accounts - can we enable them on our mirror?</h2>
<p>
The 'users' plugin in public-plugins contains user login and user groups functionality.
This plugin requires ensembl-orm (part of ensembl-website CVS checkout),
which in turn has a dependency on Rose::DB::Object (<a title="Rose::DB::Object on CPAN" href="http://search.cpan.org/~jsiracusa/Rose-DB-Object/">on CPAN</a>).
Thus for the users plugin to work, Rose must be installed and the plugins file needs to contain this extra declaration above the EnsEMBL::Ensembl declaration.
</p>
<pre>
'EnsEMBL::Users' => $SiteDefs::ENSEMBL_SERVERROOT.'/public-plugins/users',
'EnsEMBL::Ensembl' => $SiteDefs::ENSEMBL_SERVERROOT.'/public-plugins/ensembl'
</pre>

<p>Also make sure that your mail server name and mail command are set correctly,
otherwise your users will not receive their activation emails, group invitations, etc.</p>

<p>Note that you will need a MySQL server to store user account information - SQLite is not 
supported for user accounts.</p>

<h2 id="sqlite">Configurations are not stored if I don't have a local MySQL server?</h2>
<p>
  If you to not need to install a local MySQL server (because you are pointing to the ensembldb.ensembl.org databases,
  then you can use SQLite. Install SQLite as outlined in the non-Ensembl code page and then include the SQLite plugin in your conf/Plugins.pm file. <strong>NOTE:</strong> only session storage (not user/group) is supported in this case.
