<h1>External Data</h1>

<!--
<p>
There are multiple ways to display your own data in Ensembl.
</p>

<ul>
<li>Attach a file at a web location (URL) address</li>
<li>Upload a file to Ensembl</li>
<li>Attach a <a href="/info/docs/das/index.html">DAS</a> source</li>
<li><a href="/info/docs/webcode/linking.html">Link</a> to Ensembl within a URL</li>
</ul>
-->

<p>
Ensembl genome location displays allow you to link in your own user
data. You can attach your data sets via the <strong>Manage your
data</strong> option in the left hand navigation column.
</p>

<p>
By default, you will be presented with the <strong>Upload
data</strong> window. This allows you to directly paste formatted
information or upload a file stored locally on your computer or at a
URL address. In any case your data will be integrated into the Ensembl
system for future use. The data set is private in the sense that it is
linked to a cookie on the computer that was used for the upload or an
Ensembl user account. You can manage or share these data sets.
</p>

<p>
Alternatively, you can click on <strong>Attach URL Data</strong> to
directly link formatted data housed at a URL. Enter a URL and
optionally a track name, then click the <strong>Next</strong>
button. Note: The following window will take some time to appear. The
disadvantage of this method is that Ensembl has to reload and re-parse
the data set with every page refresh. For larger data sets this can be
quite slow.
</p>

<p>
The <strong>Attach DAS</strong> link is also available from this
window and offers the most flexible and scalable custom annotation
method outlined in a <a href="/info/docs/das/index.html">separate
article</a>.

</ul>


<h3>Examples</h3>

<ul>

<li><a href="./example.gff">BAC end sequences in GFF format</a></li>

<li><a href="./example.psl">Human INSR gene in PSL format</a></li>

<li><a href="./example.bed">BAC end sequences in BED format</a></li>

</ul>


<h3>Advanced Options</h3>

<p>
<a rel="external"
href="http://genome.ucsc.edu/goldenPath/help/customTrack.html#lines">Browser
lines</a> and <a rel="external"
href="http://genome.ucsc.edu/goldenPath/help/customTrack.html#TRACK">track
lines</a> allow you to specify additional options regarding the region
to be displayed or the colouring and styling of individual tracks.
</p>

<p>
For the <strong>color</strong> attribute in <strong>track</strong>
lines Ensembl also accepts hexadecimal values
(<i>e.g. color=FFCC00</i>) and standard X11 colour map names
(<i>e.g. red, navajowhite</i>) in addition to RGB triplets
(<i>e.g. color=255,204,0</i>). The default is red.
</p>

<p>
Ensembl provides extensions to the <strong>useScore=X</strong>
attribute in <strong>track</strong> lines of <strong>BED</strong>
format data sets. In addition to the UCSC tiling array
(<i>i.e. useScore=1</i>), Ensembl also permits viewing as a colour
gradient, histogram or wiggle plot. Add "useScore=X" to
the <strong>track</strong> line, where X can be:
</p>

<ol>

<li>tiling array (<a href="./wiggle_ta.bed">example</a>)</li>

<li>colour gradient (<a href="./wiggle_cg.bed">example</a>)<br />
Optionally you can specify the colours for the gradient (cgColour1,
cgColour2, cgColour3) and the number of colour grades (cgGrades). By
default Ensembl will create 20 shades of the standard colour gradient:
Yellow-Green-Blue.</li>

<li>histogram (<a href="./wiggle_hg.bed">example</a>)</li>

<li>wiggle plot (<a href="./wiggle_plot.bed">example</a>)</li>

</ol>

<!--
<p>
For example:
</p>

<code>
<div class="code">track name=&quot;ColorGradient&quot;
description=&quot;ColourGradient demonstration&quot; visibility=2
useScore=2 cgGrades=50 cgColour1=white cgColour2=yellow cgColour3=red
height=30</div>
</code>

<code>track name=&quot;Histogram&quot;
description=&quot;Histogram demonstration&quot; visibility=2 useScore=3
height=30</code>

-->

<h4>Wiggle Track Format</h4>

<p>
We support fixed step and variable step
<a rel="external"
href="http://genome.ucsc.edu/goldenPath/help/wiggle.html">WIG</a>
data formats and the <a href="http://genome.ucsc.edu/goldenPath/help/bedgraph.html">BedGraph</a> format. For faster display of high density data
sets we recommend using the WIG format.
</p>

<p>
At the moment we have limited support of the wiggle track definition
lines. The supported options are:
</p>

<ul>
<li>type</li>
<li>name</li>
<li>description</li>
<li>graphType</li>
<li>viewLimits</li>
<li>autoScale</li>
</ul>

<p>
Where <em>type</em> is required and should be set to wiggle_0,
<em>graphType</em> is one of signal | colour | points | bar
</p>

<p>
For the details of configuring wiggle tracks please see
<a rel="external"
href="http://genome.ucsc.edu/goldenPath/help/hgWiggleTrackHelp.html">http://genome.ucsc.edu/goldenPath/help/hgWiggleTrackHelp.html</a>,
and for an example see
<a href="/info/using/external_data/examples/wiggle_example.wig">here</a>.
</p>

<h3>Coordinate Systems</h3>

<p>
Use either chromosome or (finished) BAC clone coordinates in custom
data sets.
</p>

<h4>Chromosome Coordinate-based Data</h4>

<p>
Chromosome coordinates are the easiest to work with since features may
be annotated across clone boundaries. However, this coordinate system
is unstable and will change with each new genome sequence assembly
build. Therefore, if you use chromosome coordinates for uploaded data
you will have to delete the data source and re-upload it in the new
coordinate system every time the genome sequence assembly is updated.
</p>

<!--
<p>
Use this
<a href="/info/using/external_data/examples/upload_chromosome.txt">test
data file</a> for a more extensive chromosome-based example.
</p>
-->

<h4>BAC Clone Coordinate-based Data</h4>

<p>
BAC clone coordinates are more stable across genome sequence assembly
builds, <strong>provided the clone version number has not
changed</strong>. However you cannot annotate features that span the
boundary of two clones, although you can create "split-features" that
annotate portions on two or more clones.
</p>

<p>
Please provide coordinates on finished clones only, for which a single
contig sequence spanning the full clone length is available. If you
provide data on unfinished clones, which contain more than one contig
sequence, they will be <strong>ignored</strong>.
</p>

<p>
First enter any chromosomal and/or clone coordinate data you wish to
display in the same <strong>tab-separated</strong> column format, as
explained in the section above.
</p>

<p>
Next you must provide a list of clones you have annotated without
version suffixes, their type, usually just "Clone" and their total
lengths in base pairs. This information needs to appear below the
feature data and separated from it using the special heading
"[references]" on a line of its own.
</p>

<p>
eg:
</p>

<pre>
Similarity	AL137655.1.1	homology	wutblastn	AP000869.2	4260	4340	+	.	373.0000
Similarity	Hs.326048.2	homology	wutblastn	AP000869.2	5406	5534	+	.	373.0000

[references]
AP000869	Clone	159840

AP001267	Clone	239314
</pre>

<p>
<strong>Note: The [references] section must appear last in the file,
after all features.</strong>
</p>

<p>
To allow others to see the data set you have uploaded, click
on <strong>Manage your data</strong> at the left of Location pages,
and click on <strong>Manage data</strong> again, at the left of the
window. Use the <strong>Share</strong> link.
</p>


<p>
Optionally, a DAS source name (DSN), which Ensembl issued after a
previous upload may be provided, if a data set needs re-attachment,
amendment or replacement. Select the path to a file on your local
machine, which contains the annotation information. To reduce network
transmission time for large data volumes you may compress the data
file with
<a rel="external" href="http://directory.fsf.org/gzip.html">GNU gzip</a>,
<a rel="external" href="http://www.bzip.org/">bzip2</a> or UNIX compress.
Alternatively, data sets could be directly pasted into the box provided.

<h2 id="Disclaimer">Data Upload Disclaimer</h2>

<p>
Although your data source is allocated a unique ID and any management
operations on the data (<i>e. g.</i> deleting) require a
password, <strong>this is only trivial security</strong>. Data
uploads are made on an <strong>open, non-secure</strong> network
connection. If your data is sensitive you should not upload it but
contact Ensembl for more information.
</p>

<p>
While we undertake everything to not make uploaded data available to
any person other than the originator we <strong>DO NOT</strong>
provide any assurance whatsoever concerning data security and/or
privacy.
</p>

<p>
If you are concerned about data privacy you should consider setting up
your own secure DAS server.
