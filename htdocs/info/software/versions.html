<h2>Ensembl Versions</h2>

<p>
This page uses release [[SPECIESDEFS::ENSEMBL_VERSION]] as a version example.
We recommend always using the latest versions of code and data.
</p>


<h3 class="boxed">Ensembl Versioning Scheme</h3>
            
<p>
Each Ensembl release has an integer version number associated with it which is used to identify the correct versions of API, web code and databases that make up that release.
The idea is that components with the same release version should work together - i.e. any web site built with
'version [[SPECIESDEFS::ENSEMBL_VERSION]]' API and web code, and 'version [[SPECIESDEFS::ENSEMBL_VERSION]]' databases should work correctly.
</p>

<p>
The BioMart code has its own versioning scheme, since it is independent of the Ensembl code - see the
<a href="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/biomart/" target="external">BioMart website</a> for information on using the code separately, e.g. with the MartJ Java interface.
</p>


<h3 class="boxed">Archiv<em><span class="blue">e</span><span class="red">!</span></em> sites</h3>

<p>
Past Ensembl releases have been archived from release [[SPECIESDEFS::EARLIEST_ARCHIVE]].
For more information about the Archiv<em><span class="blue">e</span><span class="red">!</span></em>
sites and <a href="http://archive.ensembl.org/assembly.html">past assemblies</a>, see
<a href="http://archive.ensembl.org/">http://archive.ensembl.org/</a>.
</p>


<h3 class="boxed">Ensembl Code Versioning</h3>

<p>
For the APIs and the web code, a
<a href="http://directory.fsf.org/cvs.html" target="external">CVS</a> branch (essentially a named snapshot of the code) is made for each release and named with the release version number.
The
<a href="./api_installation.html">Perl API</a> and
<a href="./website/installation/build.html#cvs_co">web code</a>
can be checked out of CVS with the tag "branch-ensembl-versionnumber",
e.g. branch-ensembl-[[SPECIESDEFS::ENSEMBL_VERSION]].
</p>


<h3 class="boxed">Ensembl Data Versioning</h3>

<p>
The Ensembl database names have the format:
</p>

<pre>
&lt;species&gt;&lt;database type&gt;&lt;release number&gt;&lt;data version&gt;
</pre>

<p>
As an example, the name of the Human Core database for the Ensembl 32 release would be:
</p>

<pre>
homo_sapiens_core_32_35e
</pre>

<p>
A letter suffix to the data version indicates a change in data without a change in assembly; e.g. a new gene build.
</p>


<h3 class="boxed">BioMart Versioning</h3>

<p>
<a href="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/biomart/" target="external">BioMart</a> will branch less frequently than Ensembl, and the release number bears no relation to that of Ensembl.
</p>

<p>
The code can be checked out of CVS - see the <a href="./website/installation/build.html#cvs_cobiomart">installation instructions</a> for the CVS tag format.
