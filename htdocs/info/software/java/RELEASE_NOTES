Version 29.3
============

NEW:
 - Added driver factories: CoreDriverFactory, VariationDriverFactory.

CHANGES:
 - Refactored to improve support for MS SQL databases accessed via
   jDTS JDBC driver. Functionality remains the same for MySQL users.
 - Improved API documentation.



Version 29.2
============

IMPORTANT API CHANGES:

 In order to make ensj easier for new users and maintainers we have
made some changes to the package layout and some class names.
Compatibility classes have been added to minimise the impact of these
changes on core database users so existing code and configuration
files might or might not need updating.

  If you only access the core database you might start encountering
deprecation warnings which should be quickly and easily resolved by
changing class references.

  If you use the compara and/or variation database then you will need
to the package paths for all of the types from these packages. This
should be simple but perhaps a little tedious.


USER CONFIGURATION FILE CHANGES:

    If you specify the "ensembl_driver" property in your driver
configuration file it will need changing to one of those below (or
removing if you want to use the default driver implementation). If you
don't do this you will get a runtime error as the old classes can't be
found:

   # org.ensembl.driver.plugin.standard.MySQLDriver should still work
   # but is deprecated
   ensembl_driver=org.ensembl.driver.impl.CoreDriverImpl

   ensembl_driver=org.ensembl.variation.driver.impl.VariationDriverImpl

   ensembl_driver=org.ensembl.compara.driver.impl.ComparaDriverImpl


REQUIRED CODE CHANGES:

    If you specify the driver explicitly in your code (rather than via
a configuration file) then it will need to be changed to one of the
above to avoid deprecation warnings or compilation errors.

    If you use types from the variation or compara packages then their
packages references will need updating (e.g. in the import statement)
to one of these:

 org.ensembl.variation.datamodel
 org.ensembl.variation.datamodel.impl
 org.ensembl.variation.driver
 org.ensembl.variation.driver.impl

 org.ensembl.compara.datamodel
 org.ensembl.compara.datamodel.impl
 org.ensembl.compara.driver
 org.ensembl.compara.driver.impl


CHANGES:
 - Core DB driver and adaptor implementation code moved to
   org.ensembl.driver.impl and driver renamed to CoreDriverImpl.
 - Variation DB code moved to org.ensembl.variation and driver
   renamed to VariationDriver. 
 - Compara DB code moved to org.ensembl.compara.
 - Unit tests now included in ensj.jar.
 - Example.java simplified and variation database examples added.





Version 29.1

   more than one population.

Version 27.3
============

BUG FIX:
 - Several variation db related issues resolved, e.g. insertions no
   longer cause an exception when loaded.
 
CHANGES:
 - org.ensembl.compara updated to access the 'new' compara schema
   (introduced in Sept 2004). Function at present mimics what was
   available before. In particular, the stubs for multi-sequence
   alignments are unimplemented.

Version 27.2
============

BUG FIX:
 - Removed debug statments.
 - Location.getEndAsFormattedString() returned wrong value.

Version 27.1

      from large datasets at the end of large sequences.

   efficient retrieval of features.

   database than other types.
 - LocationConverter.convertToTopLevel(Location).

REMOVED

   system exists. 
 - CoordinateSystemAdaptor.getTopLevel(), no general top level

Version 20.1
============

 - MySQLLocationConverter.convert(..., setSeqRegion) now include
   sequence region in all locations, not just the head.
 - Unit test dependency on deprecated classes removed.




Version 20.0
============

Ensembl Schema 20 has some major differences compared to it's
predecessor and has required major reworkings to the ensj
adaptors. The changes focus on the way locations are stored, assembled
and converted. The new approach is based on generic sequence regions
and assemblies and the specific sequence types have been removed.

Due to the extensive schema changes some changes to the API were
necessary. It is hoped most users will only experience deprecation
warnings and that anything else will be trivial to fix. The file
Example.java provides examples of how to use the new Location class.


NEW
 - CoordinateSystem + CoordinateSystemAdaptor
 - SeqRegion + SeqRegionAttribute + SeqRegionAdaptor
 - Karyotype + KaryotypeAdaptor. These replace
   ChromosomeBand + Chromosome.getBands().


CHANGED
 - Example.java updated and extended.
 - AssemblyLocation and CloneFragment have been deprecated 
   and now extend Location. This means they still work but will
   produce warnings when your code is compiled.
 - Location is now a class rather than an interface and should be used
   instead of AssemblyLocation and CloneFragmentLocation.
 - The concept of 'map' (just the name of a coordinate system) has been upgraded to
   CoordinateSystem. 
 - Most store(...) and delete(...) methods have been disabled.


REMOVED
 Note: The functionality these offered is now avaiable via CoordinateSystem,
 SeqRegion, SeqRegionAttribute, Karyotype and their adaptors.

 - Chromosome + ChromosomeAdaptor 
 - CloneFragment + CloneFragmentAdaptor
 - Clone + CloneAdaptor




Version 19.0
============

Note: the major part of the version number, '19' in this case,
corresponds to the Ensembl Schema version it is compatible with.

Bug fix snapshot release.
