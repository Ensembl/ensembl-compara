<h2 id="addtrack">How to add custom tracks</h2>

<p>You can add a track from any species-specific page, such as <a href="/Homo_sapiens/Location/View?r=6:133017695-133161157"><strong>Region in Detail</strong></a>.  The track will automatically display in the view in which you have added it. You can also display an uploaded track in other views like <a href="/Homo_sapiens/Location/Overview?r=6:133017695-133161157"><strong>Region Overview</strong></a> and the whole <a href="/Homo_sapiens/Location/Chromosome?r=6:133017695-133161157"><strong>Chromosome</strong></a>.  To do so, click the <strong>Configure this page</strong> button at the left, and select the track within the <strong>Your data</strong> menu.  
</p> 
<p> 
To attach or upload a custom track, click the <strong>Add your data</strong> button at the left of most Ensembl views (which reads <strong>Manage your data</strong> if you already have added custom data) and upload or attach a file (see more about file types further in this document) in the resulting window.  Alternatively, if you have clicked on <strong>Configure this page</strong>, add data by navigating to the <strong>Custom data</strong> tab in the configuration window and click on <strong>Add a custom track</strong>.
</p>


<p>
To upload and display data on a <a href="/Homo_sapiens/Location/Genome?r=6:133017695-133161157"><strong>Karyotype</strong></a> view, click the <strong>Add your data</strong> or <strong>Manage your data</strong> button at the left.  At the left of the resulting menu, click <strong>Features on Karyotype</strong>.  Add IDs (such as Gene IDs like ENSG00000012048, ENSG00000139618, ENSG00000198668) or names (such as Gene names like BRCA1, BRCA2, CALM) into the box.  Click the Show features button to view them along the karyotype.
</p>

<p>
<strong>Note</strong>: for large data sets, your display options will automatically be limited to density plots rather than individual feature points.</p>

<h3>Ways to add tracks to Ensembl</h3>
<ol>
<li>Upload a file to our servers (max 5MB), from either your own computer or a location on the web (URL-based data).</li>
<li>Attach a URL, from which the file will be read each time you visit a page that has the track on.
  <ul>
  <li>either by using the Add your data link (or Manage your data if you already have custom data in Ensembl)</li>
  <li>or by <a href="/info/docs/webcode/linking.html#attachurl">creating a specific URL</a> for an Ensembl page that includes the location of your data file</li>
  </ul>
  </li>
<li>Attach a DAS (Distributed Annotation System) source, either from your own DAS server or anywhere else on the internet.
  <ul>
  <li><a href="/Help/Movie?id=224" class="popup">Watch the tutorial</a> (YouTube).</li>
  <li><a href="/info/docs/webcode/linking.html#attachurl">Attach DAS via a URL</a></li>
  </ul>
  </li>
<li>Attach a BAM file using a url, which will be read each time you visit an Ensembl page with that track turned on. Note: both the BAM file and its index file should be present on your webserver. The BAM file should have a ".bam" extension, and the index file should have a ".bam.bai" extension. E.g. Mydata.bam and Mydata.bam.bai</li>
</ol>

<h3>Coordinate Systems</h3>

<p>
Use either <a href="coords.html">chromosome</a> or (finished) 
<a href="coords.html#bacclone">BAC clone coordinates</a> in custom data sets.
</p>

</ul>

<h2 id="access">Data access and security</h2>

<h3>Saving and sharing tracks</h3>

<p>Uploaded data is saved temporarily to our filesystem and accessed
via cookie, so you can only view it from the browser in which you 
uploaded it (unless you click the share icon as below). For longer-term access to your data, you can save the 
track to our database server, but this requires an Ensembl user account.
Once logged in, you will see a 'Save' link next to your track - click
on this and the track will be transferred to the database and can be
accessed on any computer where you are logged into Ensembl.</p>

<p>Remote data is not saved to the database. Only the URL or source
name is saved to your user account, to allow you to access the file
easily from any location, without having to reattach it.</p>

<p>If you display your data on a Location view such as Region in Detail, click the sharing icon, or the <strong>Share this page</strong> button at the left, to send the same view, including your own track, to a labmate or collaborator.</p>

<h3 id="DeletingTracks">Deleting tracks</h3>

<p> 
The track will remain on your display while you navigate around the
genome. To hide the track, choose the "no display" option (empty box)
for that track in the <strong>Configure this page</strong> menu.</p>

<p>To remove the data set, click the <strong>Manage your data</strong> 
link at the left of Location. Click <strong>Manage data</strong> at the left of the
window. The tracks you have currently uploaded and/or attached will
be listed. Click delete next to any you wish to remove.
</p>

<h3 id="Disclaimer">Data Upload Disclaimer</h3>

<p>
Although your data source is allocated a unique ID and any management
operations on saved data (<i>e. g.</i> deleting) require a
password, <strong>this is only trivial security</strong>. Data
uploads are made on an <strong>open, non-secure</strong> network
connection. If your data is sensitive you should not upload it but
contact Ensembl for more information.
</p>

<p>
While we undertake everything to not make uploaded data available to
any person other than the originator we <strong>DO NOT</strong>
provide any assurance whatsoever concerning data security and/or
privacy.
</p>

<p>
If you are concerned about data privacy you should consider setting up
your own secure DAS server.
