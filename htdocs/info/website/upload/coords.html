<h1>Custom Tracks - Coordinate Systems</h1>

<h2>Chromosome Coordinate-based Data</h2>

<p>
Chromosome coordinates are the easiest to work with since features may
be annotated across clone boundaries. However, this coordinate system
is unstable and will change with each new genome sequence assembly
build. Therefore, if you use chromosome coordinates for uploaded data
you will have to delete the data source and re-upload it in the new
coordinate system every time the genome sequence assembly is updated.
</p>

<h2 id="bacclone">BAC Clone Coordinate-based Data</h2>

<p>
BAC clone coordinates are more stable across genome sequence assembly
builds, <strong>provided the clone version number has not
changed</strong>. However you cannot annotate features that span the
boundary of two clones, although you can create "split-features" that
annotate portions on two or more clones.
</p>

<p>
Please provide coordinates on finished clones only, for which a single
contig sequence spanning the full clone length is available. If you
provide data on unfinished clones, which contain more than one contig
sequence, they will be <strong>ignored</strong>.
</p>

<p>
First enter any chromosomal and/or clone coordinate data you wish to
display in the same <strong>tab-separated</strong> column format, as
explained in the section above.
</p>

<p>
Next you must provide a list of clones you have annotated without
version suffixes, their type, usually just "Clone" and their total
lengths in base pairs. This information needs to appear below the
feature data and separated from it using the special heading
"[references]" on a line of its own.

eg:
</p>

<pre>
Similarity  AL137655.1.1  homology  wutblastn AP000869.2  4260  4340  + . 373.0000
Similarity  Hs.326048.2 homology  wutblastn AP000869.2  5406  5534  + . 373.0000

[references]
AP000869  Clone 159840

AP001267  Clone 239314
</pre>

<p>
<strong>Note: The [references] section must appear last in the file,
after all features.</strong>
