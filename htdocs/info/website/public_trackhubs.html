<h1>Public Track Hubs</h1>

<p>Ensembl provides support for track hubs as a way of sharing large quantities of annotation
over the internet. A list of public track hubs is available at the <a
        href="https://trackhubregistry.org/">Trackhub Registry</a> based at
      EMBL-EBI.</p>
<p>You can search this list from the Registry
      itself, in which case you can use direct links that allow you to attach the Track hub
      to Ensembl or UCSC. Track hubs on older assemblies may have links to Ensembl
      archives (for recent releases only).</p>

[[SCRIPT::EnsEMBL::Web::Document::HTML::TrackHubRegistry]]

<p>If you wish to use a track hub that is not in the Registry, please see our online
<a href="adding_trackhubs.html">instructions on how to attach a hub</a>.</p>


<div class="info-box">
<p>Please note that the tracks turned on by default are defined by the Track hub
        provider so if there are many of these then the hub may be slow to load or unavailable</b>.</p>
