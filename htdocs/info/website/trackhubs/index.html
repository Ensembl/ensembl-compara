<h1>Track Hubs</h1>

<p>Ensembl provides support for track hubs as a way of sharing large quantities of annotation 
over the internet. A list of public track hubs is available at the 
<a href="https://trackhubregistry.org/">Track Hub Registry</a> based at EMBL-EBI.</p>
<p>You can search this list from the Registry itself, in which case you can use direct links that 
allow you to attach the Track hub to Ensembl or UCSC. Track hubs on older assemblies may have 
links to Ensembl archives (for recent releases only).</p>

[[SCRIPT::EnsEMBL::Web::Document::HTML::TrackHubRegistry]]

<p>If you wish to use a track hub that is not in the Registry, please see our online
<a href="/info/website/trackhubs/adding_trackhubs.html">instructions on how to attach a hub</a>.</p>

<div class="info-box">
<p>Please note that the tracks turned on by default are defined by the Track hub
provider so if there are many of these then the hub may be slow to load or unavailable</b>.</p>
