<h2>Gene-building on the 2x genomes</h2>

<p>The difficulties in trying to identify gene structures in draft genome 
sequence are acutely apparent when the assembly has been constructed from 
only 2x genome coverage. Erroneous sequence, mis-orientations and misplacements
occur as they do in any genome assembly, but missing sequence and fragmentation
are particular problems; many genes will be represented only partially (or not at all) 
in the assemblies, and many others (particularly those with large genomic extent) 
will be found in pieces, distributed across more than one scaffold.  
The standard Ensembl gene-build pipeline, which is based upon the alignment of
complete proteins and cDNAs to the genome sequence,  is therefore unsuitable for 
low-coverage genomes.</p> 
 
<p>We have developed a new gene-building methodology for low-coverage
genomes that relies on a whole genome alignment (WGA) to an annotated,
reference genome. The WGA underlying each annotated gene structure in
the reference genome is used to infer arrangements of scaffolds into
"gene-scaffolds" in the target genome that contain complete gene structures.</p>   

<p>The protein-coding transcripts of the reference gene structures are
projected through the WGA onto the implied gene-scaffolds in
the target genome. Small insertions/deletions that disrupt the
reading-frame of the resultant transcripts are corrected for by inserting
"frame-shift" introns into the structure.</p>

<p>When the WGA implies that the sequence containing an internal exon
is missing from the assembly, and the location is consistent with an
intra- or inter-scaffold gap, the exon is placed on the gap
sequence. This results a run of X's of the correct length in the
translation.</p>

<p>The Ensembl-annotated human genome is used as the
reference, and a whole-genome alignment between the human and target genomes
is generated in-house using BLASTz. The resulting set of local
alignments are linked into chains using the axtTools written by Jim Kent
(W.J. Kent et.al., <i>PNAS 100</i>:1484-9). A custom filter is applied to
ensure that each bp in target genome is aligned to no more than one position 
in the reference genome. It is this processed alignment from which the
gene-scaffolds are inferred and through which the reference annotation
is projected.</p>
