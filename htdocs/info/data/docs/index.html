<h2>Genome Annotation</h2>

<p>
Ensembl provides context-sensitive and display-specific information by clicking
the <span class="blue-button">Help</span> button in the title bar.
Please find additional information on the following subjects:
</p>


<h3 class="boxed">General</h3>

<ul>
<li>
<p>
<strong>Ensembl Gene Set</strong> - 
The Ensembl genome browser provides a non-redundant set of transcripts and
genes annotated with the automated Ensembl genome analysis and annotation
pipeline.

</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>
<strong>Gene-building on the 2x genomes</strong> - 
The influx of low-coverage genomes has presented a particular challenge to the 
Ensembl genebuild process, and a new methodology has been developed to cope with 
this type of assembly.

</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>
<strong>BAC Clone Ordering</strong> - 
The Ensembl project provides genome annotation and visualisation of the
annotated genomes. 
Ensembl however does not directly sequence or assemble genomes nor does it
provide clones.
Bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) clones can be ordered from other sources.

<p>
<strong>Microarray Probe Set Mapping</strong> - 
Ensembl maps microarray probe sets to the genome sequence and to Ensembl
transcripts if manufacturers provide sequences evidence for individual probe
sets.

<li>
<p>
<strong>Gene Trap Resource</strong> - 
A major goal in functional genomics is to elucidate the function of each of the
30,000 or so genes in the mammalian genome.
Gene trapping in mouse embryonic stem cells is a powerful and cost-effective
approach to create large numbers of insertional mutations in mice that are
immediately accessible to molecular characterisation.

<p>
<strong>MICER</strong> - 
The aim of the Mutagenic Insertion and Chromosome Engineering Resource (MICER)
is to provide vector sequences and information on using MICER vectors for
generating knockout mice, and for chromosome engineering.

<strong>NOD BAC clones</strong> - 
The non-obese diabetic (NOD) mouse is a model for diabetes.
