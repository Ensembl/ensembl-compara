<h2>DAS</h2>

<h3 class="boxed">The Distributed Annotation System (DAS)</h3>

<p>DAS is a specification of a protocol for requesting and
returning annotation data for genomic regions.

DAS allows sequence annotation to be stored in a
decentralised manner, by multiple third-party annotators, and
integrated on an as-needed basis by client-side software.</p>

<p>A single DAS server is designated as either an <em>annotation
server</em> or as the <em>reference server</em>.  The reference
server provides essential structural information about the
genome: the physical map which relates one <em>entry point</em>
to another (where an "entry point" is an arbitrary segment of
the sequence, such as a sequenced BAC, a contig, or a whole
assembled chromosome), the DNA sequence for each entry point,
and some standard authorship information.

Using either a freestanding application or a web site,
such as Ensembl, that acts like a DAS client, researchers can
interrogate one or more annotation servers to retrieve features
in a region of interest.  The servers return the results using a
standard data format, allowing the sequence browser to integrate
the annotations and display them in graphical or tabular form.
No attempt is made to automatically resolve contradictions
between different third-party annotations.  Indeed, the ability
to make comparisons between annotations from different centres
is one of the main uses for DAS.</p>

<p>A DAS request consists of a specially formatted URL in a
simple HTTP request (as used by any web browser), and all DAS
data are returned in an XML document.  The XML document format
which is used is derived from GFF.</p>

<p>The Ensembl project have extended the use of the DAS
specification to not only cover genomic annotations,
but to also allow for proteomic annotations and the
annotation of non-positional features.  See the text on <a
href="./ensembl_das.html">DAS in Ensembl</a> for more info about
this.</p>

Information on how you may <a href="das_server.html">set up your
own DAS server</a>.

<li>
More in-depth information about the DAS protocol,
including the full specification and future
developments of it, is available from the <a

This site also contains information about client libraries, for
people wishing to implement their own DAS clients.

<li>
There is a low volume mailing list for technical DAS discussions
(not Ensembl specific).  For information about this list see <a

<p>The Distributed Annotation System was originally developed
by Lincoln D. Stein, Sean Eddy and Robin Dowell in 2000.
