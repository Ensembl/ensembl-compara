<h1>The Ensembl Perl API</h1>


<p>Ensembl uses MySQL relational databases to store its information. A comprehensive set of 
Application Programme Interfaces (APIs) serve as a middle-layer between underlying database 
schemes and more specific application programmes. The APIs aim to encapsulate the database layout 
by providing efficient high-level access to data tables and isolate applications from data layout changes.</p>
