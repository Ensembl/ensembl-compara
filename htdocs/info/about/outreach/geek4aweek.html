<h1>Geek for a Week</h1>

<p>The Ensembl "Geek for a Week" experience is a way for Ensembl software developers 
and our scientific collaborators to work in an intensive environment for short periods 
of time on the Wellcome Genome Campus in Hinxton, UK.</p>  

<p>Visiting Geeks will be assigned a desk within the Ensembl team at the
      EMBL-EBI and have an opportunity to work on their project with direct
      access to the developers who built the tools and the Ensembl scientists
      using these for data analysis.</p>

<p>Geeks are required to bring their own laptops and provide the funding for transportation to 
Hinxton and accommodation while here.  Some prospective geeks may choose to apply for funding 
from external sources such as EMBO short term fellowships.</p>

<p>Ideal outcomes of a Geek for a Week are the incorporation of new features into the Ensembl 
code base, the development of new tools built with Ensembl technology, or intensive collaborative 
research leading to joint publications.</p>

<p>All prospective Geeks are asked to submit a short application, which includes an overall outline 
of your proposed project, a description of your experience with the Ensembl software and tools, and 
details of your work plan while visiting.  Accepted applications will normally be from developers 
or researchers with established connections to members of the Ensembl Team.</p>
      
<p>No "Geek for a Week" applications will be accepted or visits supported if non-disclosure agreements, 
material transfer agreements or any other legal agreements are required by the visiting research teams. 
Visiting requiring such agreements can be supported only via consultancy arrangements and interested 
researchers should contact the Ensembl helpdesk for more information.</p>

<p>For users interested primarily in learning about Ensembl's tools, we offer a series of short course 
both at the EMBL-EBI and around the world.  These courses include modules focused on the Ensembl genome browser, 
the Ensembl APIs, and the Ensembl BioMart.  Please see the <a href="http://www.ensembl.info/">Ensembl blog</a>  
for the current list of courses.</p>
