<h1>About the Ensembl Project</h1>
<img src="/img/ebi_building.jpg" alt="photo" title="The new EMBL-EBI building" class="float-right" style="width:200px;height:300px" />

<p>The Ensembl project was started in 1999, some years before the draft human genome was completed.
Even at that early stage it was clear that manual annotation of 3 billion base pairs of 
sequence would not be able to offer researchers timely access to the latest data. The goal of 
Ensembl was therefore to automatically annotate the genome, integrate this annotation with 
other available biological data and make all this publicly available via the web. Since the 
<a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20000815203739/http://www.ensembl.org/">website's launch in July 2000</a>, many more genomes have been added to Ensembl and the range of available data has 
also expanded to include comparative genomics, variation and regulatory data.</p>

<p>In 2009, the Ensembl Genomes project was launched with specific web portals for plant, fungal, 
invertebrate metazoan, bacterial and protist genomes. These aim to provide taxonomic reference 
points giving evolutionary context in which genes can be understood, as well as coverage of all 
major non-vertebrate experimental organisms, species of agricultural importance, pathogens and 
vectors. By 2020, Ensembl supported over 50,0000 genomes across the Ensembl and Ensembl Genomes 
websites including <a href="https://rapid.ensembl.org">Rapid Release</a>, which gives fast access 
to freshly annotated genomes, and <a href="https://covid-19.ensembl.org">COVID-19</a>, providing 
access to the SARS-CoV-2 genome.</p>

<p>The Ensembl project is co-lead by <a href="https://www.ebi.ac.uk/people/person/rob-finn/">Rob Finn</a> and <a href="https://www.ebi.ac.uk/people/person/andy-yates/">Andy Yates</a> and receives input from an independent scientific advisory board. Our resources are created by a talented group numbering over 70 people, split into thematic teams developing our analysis methods, executing these analyses, developing our online resources and providing engagement with the wider scientific community.</p>

<p>Ensembl is based at the <a href="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/">European Molecular Biology Laboratory's European Bioinformatics Institute</a>, which is located on the <a href="https://www.wellcomegenomecampus.org">Wellcome Genome Campus</a> in Hinxton, south of the city of Cambridge, United Kingdom.</p>

The &quot;<a href="/info/about/outreach/geek4aweek.html">Geek for a Week</a>&quot; scheme allows developers and researchers to work alongside Ensembl team members for a short intensive collaborative project.</p>
