<h1>About the Ensembl Project</h1>

<p>The Ensembl project was started in 1999, some years before the draft human genome was completed. 
Even at that early stage it was clear that manual annotation of 3 billion base pairs of sequence
would not be able to offer researchers timely access to the latest data. The goal of Ensembl was 
therefore to automatically annotate the genome, integrate this annotation with other available 
biological data and make all this publicly available via the web. Since the website's launch in
<a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20000815203739/http://www.ensembl.org/">July 2000</a>,
many more genomes have been added to Ensembl and the range of available data has also expanded 
to include comparative genomics, variation and regulatory data.</p>

<p>The number of people involved in the project has also steadily increased. Currently, the 
Ensembl group consists of between 40 and 50 people, divided in a number of
      teams.
<ul>
<li>The Genebuild team creates the gene sets for the various species. The result of their work is stored in the 
core databases, which are taken care of by the Software team.  This team also develops and maintains 
the BioMart data mining tool.</li>
<li>The Compara, Variation and Regulation teams are responsible 
for the comparative, variation and regulatory data, respectively.</li>
<li>The Web team makes sure that all data are presented on the website in a
          clear and user-friendly way.</li>
<li>The Production team are responsible for coordinating the regular updates to Ensembl data.</li>
<li>Finally the Outreach 
team answers questions from users and gives workshops worldwide about the use of
        Ensembl.</li>
</ul>
The Ensembl project is headed by 
<a href="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/about/people/paul-flicek" rel="external">Paul Flicek</a>
and receives input from an independent <a href="sab.html">scientific advisory board</a>.</p>

<p>Ensembl is based at the <a href="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/">European Molecular Biology Laboratory's European Bioinformatics Institute</a> (EMBI-EBI), which is located on the <a href="https://www.wellcomegenomecampus.org/">Wellcome Genome Campus</a> in Hinxton, south of the city of Cambridge, United Kingdom.</p>

<h2>Assemblies and sequence</h2>

<p>The DNA sequences and assemblies used in the Ensembl genebuild are provided by various projects around the world. Please see individual species' home pages for acknowledgements.</p>

<p>In order to improve consistency between the data provided by different genome browsers, Ensembl has entered into an agreement with UCSC and NCBI with regard to sequence identifiers:</p>
