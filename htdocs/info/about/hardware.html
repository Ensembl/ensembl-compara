<h1>System Architecture</h1>

<p>
We are sometimes asked about the hardware needed to run a site 
like www.ensembl.org. Whilst we give minimum requirements in our 
<a href="/info/docs/webcode/mirror/requirements.html">technical documentation</a>,
this is obviously insufficient to run a website that gets millions
of hits per year!
</p>

<p>The specifications of individual machines varies, depending
on requirements, but at the time of writing (2013) they typically 
have 12 CPUs and 48GB of RAM.
</p>

<p>The diagram below shows a simplified version of the hardware
architecture, omitting network details such as load-balancers.

<h2>Webservers</h2>

<p>We currently run 8 Apache webservers, 6 for the Ensembl webcode 
itself and 2 for our biomart installation. We keep biomart on separate
hardware as queries can be very large and overload the servers; the 
separation ensures that if this occurs, it will not degrade service on
the rest of the website.
</p>

<h2>Search engine</h2>

<p>Our Solr search engine runs on a separate set of 4 Tomcat servers.</p>

<h2>Databases</h2>

<p>Our data is served from 8 MySQL database servers:</p>

<ul>
<li>2 for all the individual species' databases;</li>
<li>2 for non-species-specific databases: compara, help, etc</li>
<li>2 for mart databases</li>
<li>1 for user account and session databases</li>
<li>1 for the Ensembl Tools tickets (BLAST, etc)</li>
</ul>


</ul>
