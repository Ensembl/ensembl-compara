<h1>Ensembl Image Reuse</h1>

<h2>Definition</h2>

<p>
Image reuse is the extraction of images from the Ensembl resource for the use in other media such as a figure in a manuscript. Media includes, but is not limited to, presentations, journal manuscripts, academic manuscripts, newspapers, websites or books. No distinction is made between online or printed media. The Ensembl resource refers to the Ensembl website, tools and data produced by Ensembl.
</p>

<h2>Policy</h2>

<p>
Images generated by Ensembl resources as image file exports, captured by screenshot, or through any other mechanism may be used in other media including by any service which may receive funds from the redistribution of those images. Images may be modified or adapted for presentation as long as the modifications are not scientifically misleading. All modified images should be labeled as such and all use should be accompanied with a <a href='/info/about/publications.html'>citation back to Ensembl</a>.
