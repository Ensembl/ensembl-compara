<h1>Ensembl Privacy Statement</h1>

<p>Information provided to or gathered by ensembl.org is controlled by the Ensembl Project, 
based at the <a href="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/">European Bioinformatics Institute</a> near Cambridge, UK.</p>

<p>Ensembl.org gathers information about users solely to improve the usability and usefulness of the site,
and not for any commercial purposes. No use is made of users' contact information except when
directly requested by them, e.g. to sign up for a mailing list or activate a user account.
Other information collected during the course of your usage of the site, such as pages visited, may be
collected in server log files and used for statistical analysis of traffic patterns.</p>

<p>Ensembl and its satellite sites (including archives) conform to the
<a href="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/about/terms-of-use">EBI terms of use</a>. .</p>

<h2>Use of Cookies</h2>

<p>A full list of cookies used by EBI sites, including ones from Ensembl, may be found
on the <a href="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/about/cookie-control">EBI cookie control page</a>,
along with instructions on how to manage cookies in your web browser.</p>

<h2>Additional information held in user accounts</h2>

<p>All Ensembl data that is publically available for download is also freely available via the website.
For the convenience of users we have introduced a wholly voluntary system of user accounts, through which
we can offer additional services such as saved configurations and user groups. Of necessity, all user 
accounts are accessible to the Ensembl web database administrators. However
passwords are stored in one-way encrypted format and cannot be retrieved by staff.</p>

<p>The public release of the Ensembl database includes a <b>blank</b> copy of the user database,
for use in setting up a local copy if required.</p>
